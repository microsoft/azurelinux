Subject: pam_cap: Fix potential configuration parsing error

The current configuration parsing does not actually skip user names
that do not start with @, but instead treats the name as a group
name for further parsing, which can result in matching unexpected
capability sets and may trigger potential security issues.  Only
names starting with @ should be parsed as group names.

Subject: [PATCH] net/tftp: Prevent a UAF and double-free from a failed seek

A malicious tftp server can cause UAFs and a double free.

An attempt to read from a network file is handled by grub_net_fs_read(). If
the read is at an offset other than the current offset, grub_net_seek_real()
is invoked.

In grub_net_seek_real(), if a backwards seek cannot be satisfied from the
currently received packets, and the underlying transport does not provide
a seek method, then grub_net_seek_real() will close and reopen the network
protocol layer.

For tftp, the ->close() call goes to tftp_close() and frees the tftp_data_t
file->data. The file->data pointer is not nulled out after the free.

If the ->open() call fails, the file->data will not be reallocated and will
continue point to a freed memory block. This could happen from a server
refusing to send the requisite ack to the new tftp request, for example.

The seek and the read will then fail, but the grub_file continues to exist:
the failed seek does not necessarily cause the entire file to be thrown
away (e.g. where the file is checked to see if it is gzipped/lzio/xz/etc.,
a read failure is interpreted as a decompressor passing on the file, not as
an invalidation of the entire grub_file_t structure).

This means subsequent attempts to read or seek the file will use the old
file->data after free. Eventually, the file will be close()d again and
file->data will be freed again.

Mark a net_fs file that doesn't reopen as broken. Do not permit read() or
close() on a broken file (seek is not exposed directly to the file API -
it is only called as part of read, so this blocks seeks as well).

As an additional defence, null out the ->data pointer if tftp_open() fails.
That would have lead to a simple null pointer dereference rather than
a mess of UAFs.

This may affect other protocols, I haven't checked.

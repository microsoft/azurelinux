Subject: [PATCH] chainloader: Fix gcc9 error -Waddress-of-packed-member

The address of fp->path_name could be unaligned since seeking into the
device path buffer for a given node could end in byte boundary.

The fix is using aligned buffer allocated by grub_malloc for receiving
the converted UTF16 string by grub_utf8_to_utf16 and also the processing
after. The resulting string then gets copied to fp->path_name.

[  243s] ../../grub-core/loader/efi/chainloader.c: In function 'copy_file_path':
[  243s] ../../grub-core/loader/efi/chainloader.c:136:32: error: taking address of packed member of 'struct grub_efi_file_path_device_path' may result in an unaligned pointer value [-Werror=address-of-packed-member]

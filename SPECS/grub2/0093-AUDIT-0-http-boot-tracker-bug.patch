Subject: [PATCH] AUDIT-0: http boot tracker bug

Fixing a memory leak in case of error, and a integer overflow, leading to a
heap overflow due to overly large chunk sizes.

We need to check against some maximum value, otherwise values like 0xffffffff
will eventually lead in the allocation functions to small sized buffers, since
the len is rounded up to the next reasonable alignment. The following memcpy
will then smash the heap, leading to RCE.

This is no big issue for pure http boot, since its going to execute an
untrusted kernel anyway, but it will break trusted boot scenarios, where only
signed code is allowed to be executed.

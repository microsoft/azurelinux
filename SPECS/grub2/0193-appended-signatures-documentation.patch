+@node Using appended signatures
+@section Using appended signatures in GRUB
+
+GRUB supports verifying Linux-style 'appended signatures' for secure boot.
+Appended signatures are PKCS#7 messages containing a signature over the
+contents of a file, plus some metadata, appended to the end of a file. A file
+with an appended signature ends with the magic string:
+
+@example
+~Module signature appended~\n
+@end example
+
+where @code{\n} represents the line-feed character, @code{0x0a}.
+
+Certificates can be managed at boot time using the @pxref{trust_certificate},
+@pxref{distrust_certificate} and @pxref{list_certificates} commands.
+Certificates can also be built in to the core image using the @code{--x509}
+parameter to @command{grub-install} or @command{grub-mkimage}.
+
+A file can be explictly verified using the @pxref{verify_appended} command.
+
+Only signatures made with the SHA-256 or SHA-512 hash algorithm are supported,
+and only RSA signatures are supported.
+
+A file can be signed with the @command{sign-file} utility supplied with the
+Linux kernel source. For example, if you have @code{signing.key} as the private
+key and @code{certificate.der} as the x509 certificate containing the public key:
+
+@example
+sign-file SHA256 signing.key certificate.der vmlinux vmlinux.signed
+@end example
+
+Enforcement of signature verification is controlled by the
+@code{check_appended_signatures} variable.
+
+@itemize
+@item @samp{no}: no verification is performed. This is the default when GRUB
+      is not in @pxref{Lockdown} mode.
+@item @samp{enforce}: verification is performed. Verification can be disabled
+      by setting the variable back to @samp{no}.
+@item @samp{forced}: verification is performed and cannot be disabled. This is
+      set when GRUB is in Lockdown when the appendedsig module is loaded.
+@end itemize
+
+Unlike GPG-style signatures, not all files loaded by GRUB are required to be
+signed. Once verification is turned on, the following file types will have
+appended signatures verified:
+
+@itemize
+@item Linux kernels
+@item GRUB modules, except those built into the core image
+@item Any new certificate files to be trusted
+@end itemize
+
+ACPI tables and Device Tree images will not be checked for appended signatures
+but must be verified by another mechanism such as GPG-style signatures before
+they will be loaded.
+
+Unless lockdown mode is enabled, signature checking does @strong{not}
+stop an attacker with console access from dropping manually to the GRUB
+console and executing:
+
+@example
+set check_appended_signatures=no
+@end example
+
+Refer to the section on password-protecting GRUB (@pxref{Authentication
+and authorisation}) for more information on preventing this.
+
+Additionally, unless lockdown mode is enabled:
+
+@itemize
+@item Special care must be taken around the @command{loadenv} command, which
+      can be used to turn off @code{check_appended_signature}.
+
+@item If the grub configuration file is loaded from the disk, anyone who can
+      modify the file on disk can turn off @code{check_appended_signature}.
+      Consider embedding the configuration into the core grub image.

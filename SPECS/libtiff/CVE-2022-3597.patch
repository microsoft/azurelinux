Subject: [PATCH] tiffcrop: disable incompatibility of -Z, -X, -Y, -z options
 with any PAGE_MODE_x option (fixes #411 and #413)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

tiffcrop does not support â€“Z, -z, -X and â€“Y options together with any other PAGE_MODE_x options like  -H, -V, -P, -J, -K or â€“S.

Code analysis:

With the options â€“Z, -z, the crop.selections are set to a value > 0. Within main(), this triggers the call of processCropSelections(), which copies the sections from the read_buff into seg_buffs[].
In the following code in main(), the only supported step, where that seg_buffs are further handled are within an if-clause with  if (page.mode == PAGE_MODE_NONE) .

Execution of the else-clause often leads to buffer-overflows.

Therefore, the above option combination is not supported and will be disabled to prevent those buffer-overflows.

The MR solves issues #411 and #413.

+
+.. program:: tiffcrop
+
+Synopsis
+--------
+
+**tiffcrop** [ *options* ] *src1.tif* … *srcN.tif* *dst.tif*
+
+Description
+-----------
+
+:program:`tiffcrop` processes one or more files created according
+to the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, specification
+into one or more TIFF file(s).
+:program:`tiffcrop` is most often used to extract portions of an image for processing 
+with bar code recognizer or OCR software when that software cannot 
+restrict the region of interest to a specific portion of the image 
+or to improve efficiency when the regions of interest must be rotated.
+It can also be used to subdivide all or part of a processed image into 
+smaller sections and export individual images or sections of images
+as separate files or separate images within one or more files derived
+from the original input image or images.
+
+The available functions can be grouped broadly into three classes:
+
+#. Those that select individual images or sections of images from the input files.
+   The options :option:`-N` for sequences or lists of individual images in the input files,
+   :option:`-Z` for zones, :option:`-z` for regions, :option:`-X` and :option:`-Y` for fixed sized selections,
+   :option:`-m` for margins, :option:`-U` for units, and :option:`-E` for edge reference provide a variety of 
+   ways to specify portions of the input image.
+
+#. Those that allow the individual images or selections to be exported to one or
+   more output files in different groupings and control the organization of the 
+   data in the output images. The options :option:`-P` for page size grouping, :option:`-S` for 
+   subdivision into columns and rows and :option:`-e` for export mode options that produce
+   one or more files from each input image. The options :option:`-r`, :option:`-s`, :option:`-t`, :option:`-w`  control 
+   strip and tile format and sizes while :option:`-B`, :option:`-L`, :option:`-c`, :option:`-f` modify the endian addressing
+   scheme, the compression options, and the bit fill sequence of images as they
+   are written.
+
+#. Those that perform some action on each image that is selected from the input file.
+   The options include :option:`-R` for rotate, :option:`-I` for inversion of the photometric 
+   interpretation and/or data values, and :option:`-F` to flip (mirror) the image horizontally
+   or vertically.
+
+Functions are applied to the input image(s) in the following order:
+cropping, fixed area extraction, zone and region extraction, 
+inversion, mirroring, rotation.
+
+Functions are applied to the output image(s) in the following order:
+export mode options for grouping zones, regions, or images into
+one or more files, *or* row and column divisions with output margins,
+*or* page size divisions with page orientation options.
+
+Finally, strip, tile, byte order, output resolution, and compression options are
+applied to all output images.
+
+The output file(s) may be organized and compressed using a different
+algorithm from the input files.
+By default, :program:`tiffcrop` will copy all the understood tags in a TIFF
+directory of an input file to the associated directory in the output file.
+Options can be used to force the resultant image to be written as strips 
+or tiles of data, respectively.
+
+:program:`tiffcrop` can be used to reorganize the storage characteristics of data
+in a file, and to reorganize, extract, rotate, and otherwise
+process the image data as specified at the same time whereas 
+:program:`tiffcp` does not alter the image data within the file.
+
+Using the options for selecting individual input images and the
+options for exporting images and/or segments defined as zones or
+regions of each input image, :program:`tiffcrop` can perform the
+functions of :program:`tiffcp` and :program:`tiffsplit` in a single pass
+while applying multiple operations to individual selections or images.
+
+Options
+-------
+
+.. option:: -h
+
+  Display the syntax summary for tiffcrop.
+
+.. option:: -v
+
+  Report the current version and last modification date for tiffcrop.
+
+.. option:: -N odd|even|#,#-#,#|last
+
+  Specify one or more series or range(s) of images within each file to process.
+  The words ``odd`` or ``even``
+  may be used to specify all odd or even numbered images counting from one.
+  Note that internally, TIFF images are numbered from zero rather than one
+  but since this convention is not obvious to most users, :program:`tiffcrop` used 1
+  to specify the first image in a multipage file.  The word ``last``
+  may be used in place of a number in the sequence to indicate the
+  final image in the file without knowing how many images there are.
+  Ranges of images may be specified with a dash and multiple sets
+  can be indicated by joining them in a comma-separated list. eg. use
+  ``-N 1,5-7,last``
+  to process the 1st, 5th through 7th, and final image in the file.
+
+.. option:: -E top|bottom|left|right
+
+  Specify the ``top``, ``bottom``, ``left``, or ``right`` edge as the reference from
+  which to calculate the width and length of crop regions or sequence
+  of positions for zones. When used with the :option:`-e` option for exporting
+  zones or regions, the reference edge determines how composite images
+  are arranged. Using ``-E left`` or ``-E right`` causes successive zones or
+  regions to be merged horizontally whereas using ``-E top`` or ``-E bottom``
+  causes successive zones or regions to be arranged vertically. This
+  option has no effect on export layout when multiple zones or regions
+  are not being exported to composite images. Edges may be abbreviated
+  to the first letter.
+
+.. option:: -e combined|divided|image|multiple|separate
+
+  Specify the export mode for images and selections from input images.
+  The final filename on the command line is considered to be the
+  destination file or filename stem for automatically generated
+  sequences of files. Modes may be abbreviated to the first letter.
+
+  .. list-table:: Export modes
+    :widths: 5 20
+    :header-rows: 1
+
+    * - Export mode
+      - Description
+
+    * - combined
+      - All images and selections are written to a single file with
+        multiple selections from one image combined into a single image (default)
+    * - divided
+      - All images and selections are written to a single file
+        with each selection from one image written to a new image
+    * - image
+      - Each input image is written to a new file (numeric filename sequence)
+        with multiple selections from the image combined into one image
+    * - multiple
+      - Each input image is written to a new file (numeric filename sequence)
+        with each selection from the image written to a new image
+    * - separate
+      - Individual selections from each image are written to separate files
+
+.. option:: -U in|cm|px
+
+  Specify the type of units to apply to dimensions for margins and
+  crop regions for input and output images. Inches or centimeters
+  are converted to pixels using the resolution unit specified in the
+  TIFF file (which defaults to inches if not specified in the IFD).
+
+.. option:: -m top,left,bottom,right
+
+  Specify margins to be removed from the input image. The order must
+  be *top*, *left*, *bottom*, *right* with only commas separating the elements
+  of the list. Margins are scaled according to the current units and
+  removed before any other extractions are computed.
+
+.. option:: -X #
+
+  Set the horizontal (X-axis) dimension of a region to extract relative to
+  the specified origin reference. If the origin is the top or bottom
+  edge, the X axis value will be assumed to start at the left edge.
+
+.. option:: -Y #
+
+  Set the vertical (Y-axis) dimension of a region to extract relative to
+  the specified origin reference. If the origin is the left or right
+  edge, the Y axis value will be assumed to start at the top.
+
+.. option:: -Z  #:#,#:#
+
+  Specify zones of the image designated as position X of Y equal sized portions
+  measured from the reference edge,  eg 1:3 would be first third of the
+  image starting from the reference edge minus any margins specified
+  for the confining edges. Multiple zones can be specified as a comma
+  separated list but they must reference the same edge. To extract the
+  top quarter and the bottom third of an image you would use
+  ``-Z 1:4,3:3``.
+
+.. option:: -z x1,y1,x2,y2: ... :xN,yN,xN+1,yN+1
+
+  Specify a series of coordinates to define regions for processing and exporting.
+  The coordinates represent the top left and lower right corners of each region
+  in the current units, eg inch, cm, or pixels. Pixels are counted from one to
+  width or height and inches or cm are calculated from image resolution data.
+
+  Each colon delimited series of four values represents the horizontal and vertical
+  offsets from the top and left edges of the image, regardless of the edge specified
+  with the :option:`-E` option. The first and third values represent the horizontal offsets of
+  the corner points from the left edge while the second and fourth values represent
+  the vertical offsets from the top edge.
+
+.. option:: -F horiz|vert
+
+  Flip, ie mirror, the image or extracted region horizontally or vertically.
+
+.. option:: -R 90|180|270
+
+  Rotate the image or extracted region 90, 180, or 270 degrees clockwise.
+
+.. option:: -I [black|white|data|both]
+
+  Invert color space, eg dark to light for bilevel and grayscale images.
+  This can be used to modify negative images to positive or to correct
+  images that have the ``PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION`` tag set incorrectly.
+  If the value is black or white, the ``PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION`` tag is set to
+  MinIsBlack or MinIsWhite, without altering the image data. If the argument
+  is data or both, the data values of the image are modified. Specifying both
+  inverts the data and the ``PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION`` tag, whereas using data
+  inverts the data but not the ``PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION`` tag.
+  No support for modifying the color space of color images in this release.
+
+.. option:: -H #
+
+  Set the horizontal resolution of output images to *#*,
+  expressed in the current units.
+
+.. option:: -V #
+
+  Set the vertical resolution of the output images to *#*
+  expressed in the current units.
+
+.. option:: -J #
+
+  Set the horizontal margin of an output page size to *#*
+  expressed in the current units when sectioning image into *columns* × *rows*
+  subimages using the :option:`-S` ``cols:rows`` option.
+
+.. option:: -K #
+
+  Set the vertical margin of an output page size to *#* 
+  expressed in the current units when sectioning image into *columns* × *rows*
+  subimages using the :option:`-S` ``cols:rows`` option.
+
+.. option:: -O portrait|landscape|auto
+
+  Set the output orientation of the pages or sections.
+  Auto will use the arrangement that requires the fewest pages.
+  This option is only meaningful in conjunction with the :option:`-P`
+  option to format an image to fit on a specific paper size.
+
+.. option:: -P page
+
+  Format the output images to fit on page size paper. Use
+  ``-P list`` to show the supported page sizes and dimensions.
+  You can define a custom page size by entering the width and length of the
+  page in the current units with the following format ``#.#x#.#``.
+
+.. option:: -S cols:rows
+
+  Divide each image into cols across and rows down equal sections.
+
+.. option:: -B
+
+  Force output to be written with Big-Endian byte order.
+  This option only has an effect when the output file is created or
+  overwritten and not when it is appended to.
+
+.. option:: -C
+
+  Suppress the use of "strip chopping" when reading images
+  that have a single strip/tile of uncompressed data.
+
+.. option:: -c
+
+  Specify the compression to use for data written to the output file:
+  :command:`-c none` for no compression,
+  :command:`-c packbits` for PackBits compression,
+  :command:`-c lzw` for Lempel-Ziv & Welch compression,
+  :command:`-c jpeg` for baseline JPEG compression.
+  :command:`-c zip` for Deflate compression,
+  :command:`-c g3` for CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression,
+  :command:`-c g4` for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression.
+  By default :program:`tiffcrop` will compress data according to the value of the
+  ``Compression`` tag found in the source file.
+
+  The CCITT Group 3 and Group 4 compression algorithms can only
+  be used with bilevel data.
+
+  Group 3 compression can be specified together with several
+  T.4-specific options:
+  ``1d`` for 1-dimensional encoding,
+  ``2d`` for 2-dimensional encoding,
+  ``fill`` to force each encoded scanline to be zero-filled so that the
+  terminating EOL code lies on a byte boundary.
+  Group 3-specific options are specified by appending a ``:``-separated
+  list to the ``g3`` option; e.g. ``-c g3:2d:fill``
+  to get 2D-encoded data with byte-aligned EOL codes.
+
+  LZW compression can be specified together with a ``predictor``
+  value. A predictor value of 2 causes
+  each scanline of the output image to undergo horizontal
+  differencing before it is encoded; a value
+  of 1 forces each scanline to be encoded without differencing.
+  LZW-specific options are specified by appending a ``:``-separated
+  list to the ``lzw`` option; e.g. ``-c lzw:2`` for LZW
+  compression with horizontal differencing.
+
+.. option:: -f
+
+  Specify the bit fill order to use in writing output data.
+  By default, :program:`tiffcrop`
+  will create a new file with the same fill order as the original.
+  Specifying
+  ``-f lsb2msb``
+  will force data to be written with the ``FillOrder`` tag set to
+  ``LSB2MSB``, while
+  ``-f msb2lsb`` will force data to be written with the ``FillOrder``
+  tag set to ``MSB2LSB``.
+
+.. option:: -i
+
+  Ignore non-fatal read errors and continue processing of the input file.
+
+.. option:: -k size
+
+  Set maximum memory allocation size (in MiB). The default is 256MiB.
+  Set to 0 to disable the limit.
+
+.. option:: -l
+
+  Specify the length of a tile (in pixels).
+  :program:`tiffcrop` attempts to set the tile dimensions so
+  that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.
+
+.. option:: -L
+
+  Force output to be written with Little-Endian byte order.
+  This option only has an effect when the output file is created or
+  overwritten and not when it is appended to.
+
+.. option:: -M
+
+  Suppress the use of memory-mapped files when reading images.
+
+.. option:: -p
+
+  Specify the planar configuration to use in writing image data
+  that has more than one sample per pixel.
+  By default, :program:`tiffcrop`
+  will create a new file with the same planar configuration as
+  the original.
+  Specifying :command:`-p contig`
+  will force data to be written with multi-sample data packed
+  together, while
+  :command:`-p separate`
+  will force samples to be written in separate planes.
+
+.. option:: -r
+
+  Specify the number of rows (scanlines) in each strip of data
+  written to the output file.
+  By default (or when value **0** is specified), :program:`tiffcrop`
+  attempts to set the rows/strip that no more than 8 kilobytes of 
+  data appear in a strip. If you specify the special value
+  **-1** it will results in infinite number of the rows per strip. The entire image
+  will be the one strip in that case.
+
+.. option:: -s
+
+  Force the output file to be written with data organized in strips
+  (rather than tiles).
+
+.. option:: -t
+
+  Force the output file to be written with data organized in tiles
+  (rather than strips).
+
+.. option:: -w
+
+  Specify the width of a tile (in pixels).
+  :program:`tiffcrop` attempts to set the tile dimensions so
+  that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a tile.
+
+.. option:: -D opt1:value1,opt2:value2,opt3:value3:opt4:value4
+
+  Debug and dump facility
+
+  Display program progress and/or dump raw data to non-TIFF files.
+  Options include the following and must be joined as a comma
+  separated list. The use of this option is generally limited to
+  program debugging and development of future options. An equal sign
+  may be substituted for the colon in option:value pairs.
+
+  ``debug:N``:
+
+    Display limited program progress indicators where larger *N*
+    increases the level of detail.
+
+  ``format:txt|raw``:
+
+    Format any logged data as ASCII text or raw binary 
+    values. ASCII text dumps include strings of ones and zeroes representing
+    the binary values in the image data plus identifying headers.
+
+  ``level:N``:
+
+    Specify the level of detail presented in the dump files.
+    This can vary from dumps of the entire input or output image data to dumps
+    of data processed by specific functions. Current range of levels is 1 to 3.
+
+  ``input:full-path-to-directory/input-dumpname``:
+
+  ``output:full-path-to-directory/output-dumpname``:
+
+    When dump files are being written, each image will be written to a separate
+    file with the name built by adding a numeric sequence value to the dumpname
+    and an extension of :file:`.txt` for ASCII dumps or :file:`.bin` for binary dumps.
+
+  The four debug/dump options are independent, though it makes little sense to
+  specify a dump file without specifying a detail level.
+
+  Note: :program:`tiffcrop` may be compiled with :command:`-DDEVELMODE` to enable
+  additional very low level debug reporting.
+
+However, not all option combinations are permitted.
+
+  Note 1: The (-X|-Y), -Z, -z and -S options are mutually exclusive.
+  In no case should the options be applied to a given selection successively.
+
+  Note 2: Any of the -X, -Y, -Z and -z options together with other PAGE_MODE_x options
+  such as -H, -V, -P, -J or -K are not supported and may cause buffer overflows.
+  
+Examples
+--------
+
+The following concatenates two files and writes the result using LZW
+encoding:
+
+.. highlight:: shell
+
+::
+
+    tiffcrop -c lzw a.tif b.tif result.tif
+
+To convert a G3 1d-encoded TIFF to a single strip of G4-encoded data the following might be used:
+
+::
+
+    tiffcrop -c g4 -r 10000 g3.tif g4.tif
+
+(1000 is just a number that is larger than the number of rows in
+the source file.)
+
+To extract a selected set of images from a multi-image TIFF file 
+use the :option:`-N` option described above. Thus, to copy the 1st and 3rd
+images of image file :file:`album.tif` to :file:`result.tif`:
+
+::
+
+    tiffcrop -N 1,3 album.tif result.tif
+
+Invert a bilevel image scan of a microfilmed document and crop off margins of
+0.25 inches on the left and right, 0.5 inch on the top, and 0.75 inch on the
+bottom. From the remaining portion of the image, select the second and third
+quarters, ie, one half of the area left from the center to each margin:
+
+::
+
+    tiffcrop -U in -m 0.5,0.25,0.75,0.25 -E left -Z 2:4,3:4 -I both MicrofilmNegative.tif MicrofilmPostiveCenter.tif
+
+Extract only the final image of a large Architectural E sized 
+multipage TIFF file and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise while 
+reformatting the output to fit on tabloid sized sheets with one 
+quarter of an inch on each side:
+
+::
+
+    tiffcrop -N last -R 90 -O auto -P tabloid -U in -J 0.25 -K 0.25 -H 300 -V 300 Big-PlatMap.tif BigPlatMap-Tabloid.tif 
+
+The output images will have a specified resolution of 300 dpi in both
+directions. The orientation of each page will be determined by whichever
+choice requires the fewest pages. To specify a specific orientation, use
+the portrait or landscape option. The paper size option does not resample
+the image. It breaks each original image into a series of smaller images
+that will fit on the target paper size at the specified resolution.
+
+Extract two regions 2048 pixels wide by 2048 pixels high from each page of
+a multi-page input file and write each region to a separate output file:
+
+::
+
+    tiffcrop -U px -z 1,1,2048,2048:1,2049,2048,4097 -e separate  CheckScans.tiff Check
+
+The output file names will use the stem :file:`Check` with a numeric suffix which is
+incremented for each region of each image, eg :file:`Check-001.tiff`,
+:file:`Check-002.tiff` … :file:`Check-NNN.tiff`. To produce a unique file for each page
+of the input image with one new image for each region of the input image on that page
+change the export option to ``-e multiple``.
+
+Notes
+-----
+
+In general, bilevel, grayscale, palette and RGB(A) data with bit depths
+from 1 to 32 bits should work in both interleaved and separate plane
+formats. Unlike :program:`tiffcp`, :program:`tiffcrop` can read and write tiled images with
+bits per sample that are not a multiple of 8 in both interleaved and
+separate planar format. Floating point data types are supported at 
+bit depths of 16, 24, 32 and 64 bits per sample. 
+
+Not all images can be converted from one compression scheme to another.
+Data with some photometric interpretations and/or bit depths are tied to 
+specific compression schemes and vice-versa, e.g. Group 3/4 compression
+is only usable for bilevel data. JPEG compression is only usable on 8
+bit per sample data (or 12 bit if :program:`libtiff`
+was compiled with 12 bit JPEG support). Support for OJPEG compressed 
+images is problematic at best. Since OJPEG compression is no longer 
+supported for writing images with LibTIFF, these images will be updated
+to the newer JPEG compression when they are copied or processed. This
+may cause the image to appear color shifted or distorted after conversion.
+In some cases, it is possible to remove the original compression from 
+image data using the option ``-c none``.
+
+:program:`tiffcrop` does not currently provide options to up or downsample data to 
+different bit depths or convert data from one photometric interpretation 
+to another, e.g. 16 bits per sample to 8 bits per sample or RGB to grayscale. 
+
+:program:`tiffcrop` is very loosely derived from code in :program:`tiffcp`
+with extensive modifications and additions to support the selection of input 
+images and regions and the exporting of them to one or more output files in 
+various groupings. The image manipulation routines are entirely new and 
+additional ones may be added in the future. It will handle tiled images with 
+bit depths that are not a multiple of eight that tiffcp may refuse to read.
+
+:program:`tiffcrop` was designed to handle large files containing many moderate sized images
+with memory usage that is independent of the number of images in the file.
+In order to support compression modes that are not based on individual 
+scanlines, e.g. JPEG, it now reads images by strip or tile rather than by 
+individual scanlines. In addition to the memory required by the input and
+output buffers associated with :program:`libtiff`
+one or more buffers at least as large as the largest image to be read are
+required. The design favors large volume document processing uses over 
+scientific or graphical manipulation of large datasets as might be found 
+in research or remote sensing scenarios.

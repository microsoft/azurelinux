Subject: [PATCH] unistr.c: Fix use-after-free in 'ntfs_uppercase_mbs'.

If 'utf8_to_unicode' throws an error due to an invalid UTF-8 sequence,
then 'n' will be less than 0 and the loop will terminate without storing
anything in '*t'. After the loop the uppercase string's allocation is
freed, however after it is freed it is unconditionally accessed through
'*t', which points into the freed allocation, for the purpose of NULL-
terminating the string. This leads to a use-after-free.
Fixed by only NULL-terminating the string when no error has been thrown.

Thanks for Jeffrey Bencteux for reporting this issue:

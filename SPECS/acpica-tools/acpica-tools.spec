# The previous iasl package contained only a very small subset of these tools
# and it produced only the iasl package listed below; further, the pmtools
# package -- which provides acpidump -- also provides a /usr/sbin/acpixtract
# that we don't really want to collide with

# The pmtools package provides an obsolete and deprecated version of the

# ACPICA, however, is providing a new version and we again do not want to
# conflict with the command name.

%description
The ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA) project provides an OS-independent
reference implementation of the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
Specification (ACPI).  ACPICA code contains those portions of ACPI meant to
be directly integrated into the host OS as a kernel-resident subsystem, and
a small set of tools to assist in developing and debugging ACPI tables.

This package contains only the user-space tools needed for ACPI table
development, not the kernel implementation of ACPI.  The following commands
are installed:
   -- iasl: compiles ASL (ACPI Source Language) into AML (ACPI Machine
      Language), suitable for inclusion as a DSDT in system firmware.
      It also can disassemble AML, for debugging purposes.
   -- acpibin: performs basic operations on binary AML files (e.g.,
      comparison, data extraction)
   -- acpidump: write out the current contents of ACPI tables
   -- acpiexec: simulate AML execution in order to debug method definitions
   -- acpihelp: display help messages describing ASL keywords and op-codes
   -- acpinames: display complete ACPI name space from input AML
   -- acpisrc: manipulate the ACPICA source tree and format source files
      for specific environments
   -- acpixtract: extract binary ACPI tables from acpidump output (see
      also the pmtools package)

This version of the tools is being released under GPLv2 license.

* Mon May 13 2019 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20190509-2
- Added an arm7hl specific fix acenv.h; GCC9 on arm7hl can now deal
  with misalignments so the unaligned patch could be relaxed a bit
- the templates test was failing because of the backup left behind
  by the patch macro, so change the invocation of the macro.

* Wed Aug 8 2018 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20180629-3
- Add in man page for acpiexamples.  So that the man page makes some sense,
  also copy the source code used for acpiexamples to the doc directory for
  this package.  Closes BZ#1611145.
- Add in the converterSample.asl file from the misc tests.  Clean up the
  run-misc-tests.sh script, too, to make it more robust by simplifying

* Tue May 22 2018 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20180508-2
- %%pre and %%post scriptlets fail -- stupid thinko where I inadvertently
  tested for alternatives not existing, vs existing

* Tue May 15 2018 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20180508-1
- Update to 20180508 source tree, including patch refeshes. Closes BZ#1544048
- acpidump/acpixtract no longer have alternatives, so remove the scriptlets
  that maintain them and just install them directly; we do leave the pre-
  and post- scriptlets to remove the alternatives for now.  Closes BZ#1576970
- Typo: OPT_LDFLAGS, not OPT_LDLAGS in the build section.  Closes BZ#1560542

* Mon May 14 2018 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20180427-1
- Update to 20180427 source tree, including patch refeshes. Closes BZ#1544048

  github patch to fix the leaks.  Resolves BZ#1485348.
- CVE-2017-13695: operand cache leak in nseval.c -- applied github patch to fix
  the leak.  Resolves BZ#1485349.
- Security fixes for the CVEs above applied.  Closes BZ#1485355.  NOTE: these
  patches fix acpica-tools ONLY; the kernel needs to be patch separately.
- Added gcc to BuildRequires
- It turns out the %%build section was incorrectly passing in OPT_CFLAGS; it
  made the wrong assumptions about what generate/unix/Makefile.config did with
  that value.  Added to the spec file what should happen so that a full and
  complete set of C flags get passed in, not just the small subset that was.
- Clean up compiler warnings for truncated strings
- Clean up compiler warnings for pointer casting on 32-bit architectures

  up all 64-bit arches, so nice to have regardless
- Add new patch for a TPM2 big-endian issue.

- This version deprecates aapits (ACPICA API Test Suite) for now; this is
  in accordance with upstream wishes, but in this maintainer's view, may
  not be the correct long term solution as there is no other API specific
  test suite.
- Add a patch to rename source/tools/acpinames/AcpiNames.h to remove the
  camel case; this is a leftover in the conversion to Un*x files.

* Wed Jun 3 2015 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20150515-2
- Replace dev-mem patch with nodevmem; this is a much more robust version of
  the functionality needed, and set up properly for arm64 -- the patch makes
  it so that acpidump does not use /dev/mem at all on arm64 since it might
  not contain the right data.

- Clarify the licensing; this source is dual-licensed and is being released
  under the GPLv2 as allowed by the original Intel license.
- Redo the misc tests so they compare results properly.

* Wed Feb 06 2013 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20130117-6
- Added a zero-fill to a date used in comparing testing results so that the
  comparison would be correct on days numbered < 10.

* Thu Jan 31 2013 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20130117-5
- Simplify versioning scheme and revert to the original scheme in use by
  iasl, which is use the latest official tarball date (2013017) as the
  version and 1%%{?dist} as the release, to be incremented for packaging
  and bug fixes as needed.

* Wed Jan 30 2013 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20130117-4
- Do a little reset: go back to using just the original upstream tarball
  instead of the latest git; the snapshot approach was more complicated
  than needed.
- Upstream tarballs split commands from test suites, so had to add the
  test suite back in as another Source: file.
- Change versioning scheme to include the APCI specification level (5.0),
  the latest official tarball date (2013017) and a revision level  (the
  .1 at the end) for packaging and bug fixes as needed.
- Changed the License field to reflect the source tarball change; the release
  tarball is dual-licensed, Intel ACPI or GPLv2.
- Updated patches to apply cleanly as needed.
- Corrected Obsoletes and Provides version numbers.

* Mon Jan 28 2013 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20130117-3
- Reconcile Fedora and Debian patches to be as alike as possible

* Mon Jan 28 2013 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20130117-2
- Verify ExcludeArch restrictions -- the architectures excluded can have
  no use for these tools.  Hardware support for ACPI is simply not
  implemented for them.
- Corrected versioning to note this source came from a git pull.
- Add License file as upstream has not yet provided one (and has not for
  many years).
- Insert properly versioned Provides and Obsoletes for iasl.
- Corrected files to use man.1* (vs man.1.gz) to allow flexibility in the
  compression being used.

* Wed Jan 23 2013 Al Stone <ahs3@redhat.com> - 20130117-1
- Clone from the current iasl package, with the intent of replacing it
- Update source to latest upstream
- NB: ACPICA documentation would normally be included in a source tarball.
  But, since it is not clearly redistributable, it is not included in the
  source RPM for this package.
- Build all ACPICA tools, not just iasl (and hence the package replacement)
- Add in brief man pages
- Set up acpixtract from this package as an alternative to the same command
  in the pmtools package
- Run the check step once built

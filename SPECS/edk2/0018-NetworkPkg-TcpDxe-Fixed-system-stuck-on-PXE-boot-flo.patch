Subject: [PATCH 18/18] NetworkPkg TcpDxe: Fixed system stuck on PXE boot flow
 in iPXE environment
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

This bug fix is based on the following commit "NetworkPkg TcpDxe: SECURITY PATCH"
REF: 1904a64

Issue Description:
An "Invalid handle" error was detected during runtime when attempting to destroy a child instance of the hashing protocol. The problematic code segment was:

NetworkPkg\TcpDxe\TcpDriver.c
Status = Hash2ServiceBinding->DestroyChild(Hash2ServiceBinding, â€‹&mHash2ServiceHandle);

Root Cause Analysis:
The root cause of the error was the passing of an incorrect parameter type, a pointer to an EFI_HANDLE instead of an EFI_HANDLE itself, to the DestroyChild function. This mismatch resulted in the function receiving an invalid handle.

Implemented Solution:
To resolve this issue, the function call was corrected to pass mHash2ServiceHandle directly:

NetworkPkg\TcpDxe\TcpDriver.c
Status = Hash2ServiceBinding->DestroyChild(Hash2ServiceBinding, mHash2ServiceHandle);

This modification ensures the correct handle type is used, effectively rectifying the "Invalid handle" error.

Verification:
Testing has been conducted, confirming the efficacy of the fix. Additionally, the BIOS can boot into the OS in an iPXE environment.

####   TESTING DISCLAIMER   ####
# This script follows the steps to run the tests for RabbitMQ v3.11.9 as of 2/22/23 on Azure Linux. As a result, this script can likely 
# be used as a baseline to execute the test for future releases/upgrades to verify the package integrity. That said, some things may need
# to be updated in order to make the tests succeed such as updating the links for erlang, elixir, bazel, and/or mandoc in order to have
# some or all tests succeed.
#
# Additionally, there are 3 tests that remain as failutres due to some additional dependencies on large packages 'aws' and 'dotnet', or in
# one case, an excluded command from openldap 'slapd' (see //SPECS/openldap/openldap.spec for details). With the other 506 test suites 
# passing, I decided to leave these as is since they also don't impact the running of the entire test suite.
#
# The 3 expected failures are the following:
# //deps/rabbitmq_peer_discovery_aws:integration_SUITE
# //deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_ldap:system_SUITE
# //deps/rabbitmq_ampq1_0:system_SUITE - shard 1 of 2 specifically
#
# RabbitMQ depends on bazel 'latest'. As of 2/22/23, the latest bazel version is '6.0.0'.
#
# Some tests also rely on the 'mandoc' package. As of 2/22/23, this package was not available in Azure Linux. As a result, the package is
# pulled from source and installed. These test break the entire run, so this dependency must be pulled in for the entire suite to succeed.
#
# The elixir package relies on having the UTF-8 character encoding set in your locale in order to function properly. Because of this, you 
# set bazel to use the UTF-8 locale that you'd like with the --test-env flag at runtime, unless UTF-8 is the true system default (in this case
# no additional flags are needed at runtime for elixir).
#
# Be sure to check the rabbitmq official repository for any testing updates before executing this script in case the process has changed in
# any capacity or become more well documentated:
#   README.md: https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/README.md
#   BAZEL.md:  https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/BAZEL.md

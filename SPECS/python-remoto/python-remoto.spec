Requires:       python3
Requires:       python3-execnet

%description -n python3-%{pkgname}
A very simplistic remote-command-executor using connections to hosts (ssh, local, containers,
and several others are supported) and Python in the remote end. All the heavy lifting is done
by execnet, while this minimal API provides the bare minimum to handle easy logging and connections
from the remote end.

remoto is a bit opinionated as it was conceived to replace helpers and remote utilities for ceph-deploy,
a tool to run remote commands to configure and setup the distributed file system Ceph. ceph-medic uses
remoto as well to inspect Ceph clusters.

Subject: [PATCH] testcase_read: error out if repos are added or the system is
 changed too late

We must not add new solvables after the considered map was created, the solver
was created, or jobs were added. We may not changed the system after jobs have
been added.

(Jobs may point inside the whatproviedes array, so we must not invalidate this
area.)

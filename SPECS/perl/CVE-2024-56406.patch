    CVE-2024-56406: Heap-buffer-overflow with tr//

    This was due to underallocating needed space.  If the translation forces
    something to become UTF-8 that is initially bytes, that UTF-8 could
    now require two bytes where previously a single one would do.

    (cherry picked from commit f93109c8a6950aafbd7488d98e112552033a3686)

Subject: [PATCH] Fix memory leak

This commit fixes memory leak that happens when PUSH_PROMISE or
HEADERS frame cannot be sent, and nghttp2_on_stream_close_callback
fails with a fatal error.  For example, if GOAWAY frame has been
received, a HEADERS frame that opens new stream cannot be sent.

This issue has already been made public via CVE-2023-35945 [1] issued
by envoyproxy/envoy project.  During embargo period, the patch to fix
this bug was accidentally submitted to nghttp2/nghttp2 repository [2].
And they decided to disclose CVE early.  I was notified just 1.5 hours
before disclosure.  I had no time to respond.

PoC described in [1] is quite simple, but I think it is not enough to
trigger this bug.  While it is true that receiving GOAWAY prevents a
client from opening new stream, and nghttp2 enters error handling
branch, in order to cause the memory leak,
nghttp2_session_close_stream function must return a fatal error.
nghttp2 defines 2 fatal error codes:

- NGHTTP2_ERR_NOMEM
- NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE

NGHTTP2_ERR_NOMEM, as its name suggests, indicates out of memory.  It
is unlikely that a process gets short of memory with this simple PoC
scenario unless application does something memory heavy processing.

NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE is returned from application defined
callback function (nghttp2_on_stream_close_callback, in this case),
which indicates something fatal happened inside a callback, and a
connection must be closed immediately without any further action.  As
nghttp2_on_stream_close_error_callback documentation says, any error
code other than 0 or NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE is treated as fatal
error code.  More specifically, it is treated as if
NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE is returned.  I guess that envoy returns
NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE or other error code which is translated
into NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE.

#
# This is an example instance-specific configuration file. See the
# httpd@.service(8) man page for detailed information on using the
# the httpd@.service with instances.
#
# To use this example, copy instance.conf to /etc/httpd/conf/foobar.conf
# This config will then used as the default configuration when
# running:
#
#   # systemctl start httpd@foobar.service
#
# The changes compared to the default are:
# - DefaultRuntime, DefaultStateDir and Pidfile renamed to instance-specific
# - default logfile names are prefixed with the instance name
# - /etc/httpd/conf.d is NOT included by default (conf.modules.d still is)
#
# Further customisations will be required for an instance to run
# simultaneously to httpd.service under the default configuration,
# e.g. changing the port used with Listen.

DefaultRuntimeDir /run/httpd/instance-${HTTPD_INSTANCE}
DefaultStateDir /var/lib/httpd/instance-${HTTPD_INSTANCE}
PidFile /run/httpd/instance-${HTTPD_INSTANCE}.pid

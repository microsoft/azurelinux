This directory holds configuration files for the Apache HTTP Server;
any files in this directory which have the ".conf" extension will be
processed as httpd configuration files.  This directory contains
configuration fragments necessary only to load modules.
Administrators should use the directory "/etc/httpd/conf.d" to modify
the configuration of httpd, or any modules.

Files are processed in sorted order and should have a two digit
numeric prefix.  See httpd.conf(5) for more information.

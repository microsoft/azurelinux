Subject: [PATCH] minizip: Check length of comment, filename, and extra field,
 in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64

These are stored in 16-bit fields in the zip file format. Passing longer
values would generate an invalid file.

Passing very long values could also cause the computation of
zi->ci.size_centralheader to overflow, which would cause heap buffer
overflow on subsequent writes to zi->ci.central_header.

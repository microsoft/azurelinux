Subject: [PATCH] dbus-marshal-validate: Validate length of arrays of
 fixed-length items

This fast-path previously did not check that the array was made up
of an integer number of items. This could lead to assertion failures
and out-of-bounds accesses during subsequent message processing (which
assumes that the message has already been validated), particularly after
the addition of _dbus_header_remove_unknown_fields(), which makes it
more likely that dbus-daemon will apply non-trivial edits to messages.

Thanks: Evgeny Vereshchagin
Fixes: e61f13cf "Bug 18064 - more efficient validation for fixed-size type arrays"
Resolves: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/-/issues/413
Resolves: CVE-2022-42011

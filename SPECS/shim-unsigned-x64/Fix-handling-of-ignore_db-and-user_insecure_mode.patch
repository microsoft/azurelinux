Subject: [PATCH 2/4] Fix handling of ignore_db and user_insecure_mode

In 65be350308783a8ef537246c8ad0545b4e6ad069, import_mok_state() is split
up into a function that manages the whole mok state, and one that
handles the state machine for an individual state variable.
Unfortunately, the code that initializes the global ignore_db and
user_insecure_mode was copied from import_mok_state() into the new
import_one_mok_state() function, and thus re-initializes that state each
time it processes a MoK state variable, before even assessing if that
variable is set.  As a result, we never honor either flag, and the
machine owner cannot disable trusting the system firmware's db/dbx
databases or disable validation altogether.

This patch removes the extra re-initialization, allowing those variables
to be set properly.

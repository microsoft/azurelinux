- Update to libpod v1.4.4
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to use the
    entire root configuration if no rootless configuration was
    present for the user, breaking rootless Podman for new
    installations
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman's pause process would block
    SIGTERM, preventing graceful system shutdown and hanging until
    the system's init send SIGKILL
  - Fixed a bug where running Podman as root with sudo -E would not
    work after running rootless Podman at least once
  - Fixed a bug where options for tmpfs volumes added with the
  - -tmpfs flag were being ignored
  - Fixed a bug where images with no layers could not properly be
    displayed and removed by Podman
  - Fixed a bug where locks were not properly freed on failure to
    create a container or pod
  - Podman now has greatly improved support for containers using
    multiple OCI runtimes. Containers now remember if they were
    created with a different runtime using --runtime and will
    always use that runtime
  - The cached and delegated options for volume mounts are now
    allowed for Docker compatability (#3340)
  - The podman diff command now supports the --latest flag
  - Fixed a bug where podman cp on a single file would create a
    directory at the target and place the file in it (#3384)
  - Fixed a bug where podman inspect --format '{{.Mounts}}' would
    print a hexadecimal address instead of a container's mounts
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not add an entry to
    container's /etc/hosts files for their own hostname (#3405)
  - Fixed a bug where podman ps --sync would segfault (#3411)
  - Fixed a bug where podman generate kube would produce an invalid
    ports configuration (#3408)
  - Podman now performs much better on systems with heavy I/O load
  - The --cgroup-manager flag to podman now shows the correct
    default setting in help if the default was overridden by
    libpod.conf
  - For backwards compatability, setting --log-driver=json-file in
    podman run is now supported as an alias for
  - -log-driver=k8s-file. This is considered deprecated, and
    json-file will be moved to a new implementation in the future
    ([#3363](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/3363))
  - Podman's default libpod.conf file now allows the crun OCI
    runtime to be used if it is installed

    older version of Systemd as init (#3295)

    with Dockerfile RUN instructions
  - The error message for running podman kill on containers that
    are not running has been improved
  - The Podman remote client can now log to a file if syslog is not
    available
  - The MacOS dmg file is experimental, use at your own risk.
  - The podman exec command now sets its error code differently
    based on whether the container does not exist, and the command
    in the container does not exist
  - The podman inspect command on containers now outputs Mounts
    JSON that matches that of docker inspect, only including
    user-specified volumes and differentiating bind mounts and
    named volumes
  - The podman inspect command now reports the path to a
    container's OCI spec with the OCIConfigPath key (only included
    when the container is initialized or running)
  - The podman run --mount command now supports the
    bind-nonrecursive option for bind mounts (#3314)
  - Fixed a bug where podman play kube would fail to create
    containers due to an unspecified log driver
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to build with musl libc
    (#3284)
  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman using slirp4netns networking
    in an environment with no nameservers on the host other than
    localhost would result in nonfunctional networking (#3277)
  - Fixed a bug where podman import would not properly set
    environment variables, discarding their values and retaining
    only keys
  - Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to run when built with
    Apparmor support but run on systems without the Apparmor kernel
    module loaded (#3331)
  - Remote Podman will now default the username it uses to log in
    to remote systems to the username of the current user
  - Podman now uses JSON logging with OCI runtimes that support it,
    allowing for better error reporting
  - Updated vendored Buildah to v1.8.4

* Mon Aug 27 2018 vrothberg@suse.com
- Consolidate libcontainers-{common,image,storage} into one package,
  libcontainers-common. That's the way upstream intended all libraries from
  github.com/containers to be packaged. It facilitates updating and maintaining
  the package, as all configs and manpages come from a central source.
  Note that the `storage` binary that previously has been provided by the
  libcontainers-storage package is not provided anymore as, despite the claims
  in the manpages, it is not intended for production use.

- Configuration files should generally be tagged as %%config(noreplace) in order
  to keep the modified config files and to avoid losing data when the package
  is being updated.

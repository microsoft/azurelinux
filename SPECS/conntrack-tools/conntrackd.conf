	# Netlink event socket buffer size. If you do not specify this clause,
	# the default buffer size value in /proc/net/core/rmem_default is
	# used. This default value is usually around 100 Kbytes which is
	# fairly small for busy firewalls. This leads to event message dropping
	# and high CPU consumption. This example configuration file sets the
	# size to 2 MBytes to avoid this sort of problems.
	#
	NetlinkBufferSize 2097152

	#
	# The daemon doubles the size of the netlink event socket buffer size
	# if it detects netlink event message dropping. This clause sets the
	# maximum buffer size growth that can be reached. This example file
	# sets the size to 8 MBytes.
	#
	NetlinkBufferSizeMaxGrowth 8388608

	#
	# If the daemon detects that Netlink is dropping state-change events,
	# it automatically schedules a resynchronization against the Kernel
	# after 30 seconds (default value). Resynchronizations are expensive
	# in terms of CPU consumption since the daemon has to get the full
	# kernel state-table and purge state-entries that do not exist anymore.
	# Be careful of setting a very small value here. You have the following
	# choices: On (enabled, use default 30 seconds value), Off (disabled)
	# or Value (in seconds, to set a specific amount of time). If not
	# specified, the daemon assumes that this option is enabled.
	#
	# NetlinkOverrunResync On

	#
	# If you want reliable event reporting over Netlink, set on this
	# option. If you set on this clause, it is a good idea to set off
	# NetlinkOverrunResync. This option is off by default and you need
	# a Linux kernel >= 2.6.31.
	#
	# NetlinkEventsReliable Off

	# 
	# By default, the daemon receives state updates following an
	# event-driven model. You can modify this behaviour by switching to
	# polling mode with the PollSecs clause. This clause tells conntrackd
	# to dump the states in the kernel every N seconds. With regards to
	# synchronization mode, the polling mode can only guarantee that
	# long-lifetime states are recovered. The main advantage of this method
	# is the reduction in the state replication at the cost of reducing the
	# chances of recovering connections.
	#
	# PollSecs 15

	#
	# The daemon prioritizes the handling of state-change events coming
	# from the core. With this clause, you can set the maximum number of
	# state-change events (those coming from kernel-space) that the daemon
	# will handle after which it will handle other events coming from the
	# network or userspace. A low value improves interactivity (in terms of
	# real-time behaviour) at the cost of extra CPU consumption.
	# Default (if not set) is 100.
	#
	# EventIterationLimit 100

	#
	# Event filtering: This clause allows you to filter certain traffic,
	# There are currently three filter-sets: Protocol, Address and
	# State. The filter is attached to an action that can be: Accept or
	# Ignore. Thus, you can define the event filtering policy of the
	# filter-sets in positive or negative logic depending on your needs.
	# You can select if conntrackd filters the event messages from 
	# user-space or kernel-space. The kernel-space event filtering
	# saves some CPU cycles by avoiding the copy of the event message
	# from kernel-space to user-space. The kernel-space event filtering
	# is prefered, however, you require a Linux kernel >= 2.6.29 to
	# filter from kernel-space. If you want to select kernel-space 
	# event filtering, use the keyword 'Kernelspace' instead of 
	# 'Userspace'.

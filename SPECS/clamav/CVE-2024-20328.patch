Subject: [PATCH] ClamD: Disable VirusEvent '%f' feature, use environment var
 instead

The '%f' filename format character has been disabled and will no longer
be replaced with the file name, due to command injection security concerns.
Use the 'CLAM_VIRUSEVENT_FILENAME' environment variable instead.

For the same reason, you should NOT use the environment variables in the
command directly, but should use it carefully from your executed script.

## Description:	Configuration for Apache 2

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
## ServiceRestart: apache2
#
# Which config file do you want to use?
# (if not set, /etc/apache2/httpd.conf is used.)
#
APACHE_HTTPD_CONF=""

## Type:	list(prefork,worker,leader,metuxmpm)
## Default:	""
## Command:	/usr/sbin/apache2-reconfigure-mpm
#
# MPM (multi-processing module) to use.
#
# Needed to determine with which MPM apache will run, as well as
# against which header files modules will be built. 
#
# If not set, the system will simply pick one of the installed MPMs.
#
APACHE_MPM=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
## ServiceReload: apache2
#
# email address of the server administrator (ServerAdmin directive)
# This address is added to the server's responses if APACHE_SERVERSIGNATURE 
# is set to "email". 
#
# If empty ("") it defaults to webmaster@$FQHOSTNAME, where FQHOSTNAME is
# taken from /etc/HOSTNAME. 
#
# Note that ServerAdmin directives inside VirtualHost statements are not
# changed, even not the one in the stock SSL virtual host block. 
#
APACHE_SERVERADMIN=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
## ServiceReload: apache2
#
# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If this is not set to valid DNS name for your host, server-generated
# redirections will not work.  See also the UseCanonicalName directive.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address anyway, and this will make 
# redirections work in a sensible way.
#
APACHE_SERVERNAME=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
## ServiceRestart: apache2
#
# Here you can name files, separated by spaces, that should be Include'd from 
# httpd.conf. 
#
# This allows you to add e.g. VirtualHost statements without touching 
# /etc/httpd/httpd.conf itself, which makes upgrading easier. 
#
APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_FILES=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
## ServiceRestart: apache2
#
# Here you can name directories, separated by spaces, that should be Include'd 
# from httpd.conf. 
#
# All files contained in these directories will be recursively included by apache.
# If a pattern like *.conf is appended, apache will use it.
#
# Examples: "/etc/apache2/my_conf/"
#           "/etc/apache2/virtual_hosts/*.conf"
#           "local/*.conf /srv/www/virtual/"
#
APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_DIRS=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	"access actions alias auth auth_dbm autoindex cgi dir env expires include log_config mime negotiation setenvif ssl suexec userdir"
## ServiceRestart: apache2
#
# [It might look silly to not simply edit httpd.conf for the LoadModule statements.
# However, since the LoadModule statements might need an absolute path to the modules,
# switching between MPMs can be quite a hassle. It's easier to just give the names here.]
#
# * list of all modules shipped with the base distribution: 
#
#    access actions alias asis auth auth_anon auth_dbm auth_digest auth_ldap
#    autoindex cache case_filter case_filter_in cern_meta cgi charset_lite
#    dav dav_fs deflate dir disk_cache echo env expires ext_filter file_cache
#    headers imap include info ldap log_config logio mem_cache mime mime_magic
#    negotiation proxy proxy_connect proxy_ftp proxy_http rewrite setenvif
#    speling ssl status suexec unique_id userdir usertrack vhost_alias 
#
#   see http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/ !
#
# * It pays to use IfDefine statements... like
#    <IfModule mod_xyz.c>
#        ....
#    </IfModule>
#
# * In the APACHE_MODULES variable, you can use mod_xyz or just xyz syntax.
#   You may also name an absolute path if you like.
#
# * NOTE ON MOD_SSL: before you can enable this module, you need a server certificate. 
#   A test certificate can be created by entering 
#   'cd /usr/share/doc/packages/apache2; ./certificate.sh' as root.
#   Also, you need to set the ServerName inside the <VirtualHost _default_:443> 
#   block to the fully qualified domain name (see /etc/HOSTNAME).
#
# * if your server certificate is protected by a passphrase you should increase the
#   APACHE_START_TIMEOUT (see above)
#
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# fairly minimal
# APACHE_MODULES="access alias auth dir log_config mime setenvif"
#
# apache's default installation
# APACHE_MODULES="access actions alias asis auth autoindex cgi dir imap include log_config mime negotiation setenvif status userdir"
# your settings
APACHE_MODULES="access actions alias auth auth_dbm autoindex cgi dir env expires include log_config mime negotiation setenvif ssl suexec userdir"

#
# Additional server flags:
#
# Put here any server flags ("Defines") that you want to hand over to 
# httpd at start time, or other command line flags.
#
# Background: Any directives within an <IfDefine flag>...</IfDefine>
#             section are only processed if the flag is defined.
#
# This could be -D SSL, for example. Or -DSTATUS.
# (it does not matter whether you "-D flag1 -D flag2" or simply "flag1 flag2")
#
# Specifying such flags here is equivalent to giving them on the commandline.
# (e.g. rcapache2 start -DReverseProxy)
#
APACHE_SERVER_FLAGS=""

# The location and format of the access logfile (Common Logfile Format).
# If you do not define any access logfiles within a <VirtualHost>
# container, they will be logged here.  Contrarywise, if you *do*
# define per-<VirtualHost> access logfiles, transactions will be
# logged therein and *not* in this file.
#
# Simply set it to empty, if you configure it yourself somewhere else.
# 
# Examples:
#
# If you would like to have agent and referer logfiles:
#
# setting it to "/var/log/apache2/referer_log referer, /var/log/apache2/agent_log agent"
#   corresponds to 
# CustomLog /var/log/apache2/referer_log referer
# CustomLog /var/log/apache2/agent_log   agent
#
# If you prefer a single logfile with access, agent, and referer information
# (Combined Logfile Format):
#
# setting it to "/var/log/apache2/access_log combined"
#   corresponds to 
# CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access_log combined

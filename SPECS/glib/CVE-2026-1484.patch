+# Backport attempt from original.patch
+
+The provided `original.patch` file appears to contain HTML from an Anubis bot challenge page rather than a valid patch (diff). As a result, it was not possible to determine the intended code changes to apply to this repository.
+
+This commit records the backport attempt and the issue encountered with the patch file content. No functional source changes were applied.
+
+If a valid patch becomes available, please re-run this backport process with the correct file.

.SH NAME
pam_krb5 \- Kerberos 5 authentication

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B auth required /lib64/security/pam_krb5.so
.br
.B session optional /lib64/security/pam_krb5.so
.br
.B account sufficient /lib64/security/pam_krb5.so
.br
.B password sufficient /lib64/security/pam_krb5.so

.SH DESCRIPTION
The pam_krb5.so module is designed to allow smooth integration of Kerberos 5
password-checking for applications which use PAM.
It creates session-specific credential caches.
If the system is an AFS client, it will also attempt to obtain tokens
for the local cell, the cell which contains the user's home directory,
and any explicitly-configured cells.

When a user logs in, the module's authentication function performs a simple
password check and, if possible, obtains Kerberos 5
credentials, caching them for later use.  When the application requests
initialization of credentials (or opens a session), the usual ticket files are
created.  When the application subsequently requests deletion of credentials or
closing of the session, the module deletes the ticket files.  When the
application requests account management, if the module did not participate in
authenticating the user, it will signal libpam to ignore the module.  If the
module did participate in authenticating the user, it will check for an expired
user password and verify the user's authorization using the .k5login file of the
user being authenticated, which is expected to be accessible to the module.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.IP debug
turns on debugging via \fBsyslog\fR(3).  Debugging messages are logged with
priority \fILOG_DEBUG\fR.

.IP debug_sensitive
turns on debugging of sensitive information via \fBsyslog\fR(3).  Debug
messages are logged with priority \fILOG_DEBUG\fR.

.IP "afs_cells=\fIcell.example.com[,...]\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so to obtain tokens for the named cells,
in addition to the local cell, for the user.  The module will guess
the principal name of the AFS service for the named cells, or it can
be specified by giving cell in the form
\fIcellname\fB=principalname\fR.

.IP always_allow_localname
tells pam_krb5.so, when performing an authorization check using the
target user's .k5login file, to always allow access when the
principal name being authenticated maps to the local user's name
(as configured using the \fIauth_to_local_names\fR and
\fIauth_to_local\fR settings in \fBkrb5.conf\fR(5), if your
implementation provides those settings).  Otherwise, if the file
exists and can be read, but the principal is not explicitly listed,
access is typically denied.  This setting is disabled by default.

.IP "armor = \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
attempt to use armoring when communicating with the KDC.
This option is currently mainly only useful for testing, as the
\fIkeytab\fR method should not be expected to work when the module
is called from an unprivileged process, and the \fIpkinit\fR
method requires that the KDC is properly configured
to offer anonymous PKINIT, and that the client is also properly
configured to trust the KDC's CA.
The default is \fBfalse\fR.

.IP "armor_strategy = \fIkeytab,pkinit\fR"
controls how the module will attempt to obtain tickets for use as armor.
The value should be a comma-separated list of methods.
Supported methods include \fIketyab\fR and \fIpkinit\fR.
The default is \fBkeytab,pkinit\fR.

.IP "banner=\fIKerberos 5\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so how to identify itself when users attempt to change their
passwords.  The default setting is "Kerberos 5".

.IP ccache_dir=\fI/tmp\fR
tells pam_krb5.so which directory to use for storing credential caches.  The
default setting is \fI/tmp\fR.

.IP ccname_template=\fIFILE:%d/krb5cc_%U_XXXXXX\fR
specifies the location in which to place the user's session-specific
credential cache.  This value is treated as a template, and these sequences
are substituted:
  %u	login name
  %U	login UID
  %p	principal name
  %r	principal's realm name
  %h	home directory
  %d	the default ccache directory (as set with \fIccache_dir\fR)
  %P	the current process ID
  %%	literal '%'
.br
If the resulting template does not end with "XXXXXX", a suffix will be added to
the configured value.
If not set, the module attempts to read the default
used by libkrb5 from \fBkrb5.conf\fP(5), and if one
is not found, the default is
\fIFILE:%d/krb5cc_%U_XXXXXX\fR".
.\" The default is \fIFILE:%d/krb5cc_%U_XXXXXX\fR".

.IP chpw_prompt
tells pam_krb5.so to allow expired passwords to be changed during
authentication attempts.  While this is the traditional behavior exhibited by
"kinit", it is inconsistent with the behavior expected by PAM, which expects
authentication to (appear to) succeed, only to have password expiration be
flagged by a subsequent call to the account management function.  Some
applications which don't handle password expiration correctly will fail
unconditionally if the user's password is expired, and this flag can be used
to attempt to work around this bug in those applications.
The default is \fBfalse\fR.

.IP cred_session
specifies that pam_krb5 should create and destroy credential caches, as it
does when the calling application opens and closes a PAM session, when the
calling application establishes and deletes PAM credentials.  This is done
to compensate for applications which expect to create a credential cache but
which don't use PAM session management.  It is usually a harmless redundancy
in applications which don't require it, so this option is enabled by default
except for these services: "\fIsshd\fR".

.IP external
.IP external=\fIsshd\fR
tells pam_krb5.so to use Kerberos credentials provided by the calling
application during session setup.
This is most often useful for obtaining AFS tokens.

.IP "ignore_afs=\fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR|\fIservice [...]\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so to completely ignore the presence of AFS, preventing
any attempts to obtain new tokens on behalf of the calling application.

.IP ignore_k5login
specifies that pam_krb5 should skip checking the user's .k5login
file to verify that the principal name of the client being authenticated is
authorized to access the user account.  (Actually, the check is performed by
a function offered by the Kerberos library, which controls which files it
will consult.)  The default is to perform the check.

.IP ignore_unknown_principals
.IP ignore_unknown_spn
.IP ignore_unknown_upn
specifies that not pam_krb5 should return a PAM_IGNORE code to libpam
instead of PAM_USER_UNKNOWN for users for whom the determined principal
name is expired or does not exist.

.IP keytab=\fIFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab\fR
tells pam_krb5.so the location of a keytab to use when validating
credentials obtained from KDCs.

.IP minimum_uid=\fI0\fR
tells pam_krb5.so to ignore authentication attempts by users with
UIDs below the specified number.

.IP multiple_ccaches
specifies that pam_krb5 should maintain multiple credential caches for this
service, because it both sets credentials and opens a PAM session, but it
sets the KRB5CCNAME variable after doing only one of the two.  This option is
usually not necessary for most services.

.IP no_initial_prompt
tells pam_krb5.so to not ask for a password before attempting authentication,
and to instead allow the Kerberos library to trigger a request for a password
only in cases where one is needed.

.IP no_subsequent_prompt
tells pam_krb5.so to only provide the previously-entered password in response
to any request for a password which the Kerberos library might make.
If the calling application does not properly support PAM conversations
(possibly due to limitations of a network protocol which it is serving),
this may be need to be used to prevent the application
from supplying the user's current password in a password-changing
situations when a new password is called for.

.IP no_user_check
tells pam_krb5.so to not check if a user exists on the local system, to skip
authorization checks using the user's .k5login file, and to create ccaches
owned by the current process's UID.  This is useful for situations where a
non-privileged server process needs to use Kerberized services on behalf of
remote users who may not have local access.  Note that such a server should
have an encrypted connection with its client in order to avoid allowing the
user's password to be eavesdropped.

.IP no_validate
.IP "no_validate=\fIvlock\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so to not attempt to use the local keytab to verify that the TGT
obtained from the realm's servers has not been spoofed.
The \fBlibdefaults\fR \fBverify_ap_req_nofail\fR setting can
affect whether or not errors reading the keytab which are encountered during
validation will be suppressed.

.IP null_afs
tells pam_krb5.so, when it attempts to set tokens, to try to get
credentials for services with names which resemble afs@\fIREALM\fR
before attempting to get credentials for services with names resembling
afs/\fIcell\fR@\fIREALM\fR.  The default is to assume that the cell's
name is the instance in the AFS service's Kerberos principal name.

.\" .IP pkinit_flags=[0]
.\" controls the flags value which pam_krb5 passes to libkrb5
.\" when setting up PKINIT parameters.  This is useful mainly for
.\" debugging.
.\" 
.\" .IP pkinit_identity=[]
.\" controls where pam_krb5 instructs libkrb5 to search for the
.\" user's private key and certificate, so that the client can be
.\" authenticated using PKINIT, if the KDC supports it.  This value
.\" is treated as a template, and these sequences are substituted:
.\"   %u	login name
.\"   %U	login UID
.\"   %p	principal name
.\"   %r	principal's realm name
.\"   %h	home directory
.\"   %d	the default ccache directory
.\"   %P	the current process ID
.\"   %%	literal '%'
.\" .br
.\" Other PKINIT-specific default, such as the locations of trust
.\" anchors, can be set in krb5.conf(5).
.\" 
.IP preauth_options=[]
controls the preauthentication options which pam_krb5 passes
to libkrb5, if the system-defaults need to be overridden.
The list is treated as a template, and these sequences are
substituted:

  %u	login name
  %U	login UID
  %p	principal name
  %r	principal's realm name
  %h	home directory
  %d	the default ccache directory
  %P	the current process ID
  %%	literal '%'

A list of recognized values should be listed in the kinit(1)
manual page as parameters for its -X option.

.IP pwhelp=\fIfilename\fR
specifies the name of a text file whose contents will be displayed to
clients who attempt to change their passwords.  There is no default.

.IP realm=\fIrealm\fR
overrides the default realm set in \fI/etc/krb5.conf\fR, which pam_krb5.so
will attempt to authenticate users to.

.IP tokens
.IP tokens=\fIimap\fR
signals that pam_krb5.so should create a new AFS PAG and obtain AFS
tokens during authentication in addition to session setup.  This is
primarily useful in server applications which need to access a user's
files but which do not open PAM sessions before doing so.  A
properly-written server will not need this flag set in order to
function correctly.

.IP trace
turns on libkrb5's library tracing.  Trace messages are
logged to \fBsyslog\fR(3) with priority \fILOG_DEBUG\fR.

.IP try_first_pass
tells pam_krb5.so to check the previously-entered password as with
\fBuse_first_pass\fR, but to prompt the user for another one if the
previously-entered one fails. This is the default mode of operation.

.IP use_first_pass
tells pam_krb5.so to get the user's entered password as it was stored by a
module listed earlier in the stack, usually \fBpam_unix\fR or \fBpam_pwdb\fR,
instead of prompting the user for it.

.IP use_authtok
tells pam_krb5.so to never prompt for new passwords when changing passwords.
This is useful if you are using \fBpam_cracklib\fR or \fBpam_passwdqc\fR to try
to enforce use of less-easy-to-guess passwords.

.IP use_shmem
.IP "use_shmem=\fIsshd\fR"
tells pam_krb5.so to pass credentials from the authentication service function
to the session management service function using shared memory, or to do so for
specific services.

.IP validate_user_user
.IP "validate_user_user=\fIgnome-screensaver\fR"
specifies that, when attempting validation of the TGT, the module should
attempt user-to-user authentication using a previously-obtainted TGT in the
default ccache if validation can't be performed using a keytab.

Summary:        First stage UEFI bootloader
Name:           shim
Version:        15.4
Release:        2%{?dist}
License:        BSD
Vendor:         Microsoft Corporation
Distribution:   Azure Linux

# This signed-shim tarball contains the shim binary signed with
# the Microsoft UEFI CA key
Source0:        signed-%{name}-%{version}-%{release_number}.tar.gz
# Currently, the tarball only contains a UEFI CA signed x86_64 shim binary.
# Upstream aarch64 shim 15.4 builds are in a bad state. They will break using
# binutils versions before 2.35, and even after that they may give
# unpredictable results. Due to this, aarch64 shims are not being accepted
# for shim signing at this time.
#
# Once upstream aarch64 shim builds stabilize and are being accepted for
# review/signing, we should update this spec to also include UEFI CA signed
# aarch64 shim binaries
ExclusiveArch:  x86_64

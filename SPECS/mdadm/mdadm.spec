%description 
The mdadm program is used to create, manage, and monitor Linux MD (software
RAID) devices.  As such, it provides similar functionality to the raidtools
package.  However, mdadm is a single program, and it can perform
almost all functions without a configuration file, though a configuration
file can be used to help with some common tasks.

- Drop a patch in that was in Neil's tree for 3.0.3 that we had pulled for
  immediate use to resolve a bug
- Drop the endian patch because it no longer applied cleanly and all attempts
  to reproduce the original problem as reported in bz510605 failed, even up
  to and including downloading the specific package that was reported as
  failing in that bug and trying to reproduce with it on both ppc and ppc64
  hardware and with both ppc and ppc64 versions on the 64bit hardware.
  Without a reproducer, it is impossible to determine if a rehashed patch
  to apply to this code would actually solve the problem, so remove the patch
  entirely since the original problem, as reported, was an easy to detect DOA
  issue where installing to a raid array was bound to fail on reboot and so
  we should be able to quickly and definitively tell if the problem resurfaces.

Subject: [PATCH] core/manager: run generators directly when we are in initrd

Some initrd system write files at ourside of /run, /etc, or other
allowed places. This is a kind of workaround, but in most cases, such
sandboxing is not necessary as the filesystem is on ramfs when we are in
initrd.

Fixes #26488.

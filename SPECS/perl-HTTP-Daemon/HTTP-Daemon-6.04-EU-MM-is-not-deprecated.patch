-If you're seeing this warning, your toolchain is really, really old* and
-you'll almost certainly have problems installing CPAN modules from this
-century. But never fear, dear user, for we have the technology to fix this!
-
-If you're using CPAN.pm to install things, then you can upgrade it using:
-
-    cpan CPAN
-
-If you're using CPANPLUS to install things, then you can upgrade it using:
-
-    cpanp CPANPLUS
-
-If you're using cpanminus, you shouldn't be seeing this message in the first
-place, so please file an issue on github.
-
-If you're using a packaging tool through a unix distribution, this issue
-should be reported to the package manager.
-
-If you're installing manually, please retrain your fingers to run Build.PL
-when present instead of Makefile.PL.
-
-This public service announcement was brought to you by the Perl Toolchain
-Gang, the irc.perl.org #toolchain IRC channel, and the number 42.

-
-* Alternatively, you are doing something overly clever, in which case you
-should consider setting the 'prefer_installer' config option in CPAN.pm, or
-'prefer_makefile' in CPANPLUS, to 'mb" and '0' respectively.
-
-You can also silence this warning for future installations by setting the
-PERL_MM_FALLBACK_SILENCE_WARNING environment variable.

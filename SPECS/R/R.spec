%description
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment
which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent
Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a
different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but
much code written for S runs unaltered under R. R, like S, is designed
around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional
functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself
written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow
the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C,
C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced
users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.

# This package's "version" and "release" must reflect the unsigned version that
# was signed.
# An important consequence is that when making a change to this package, the
# unsigned version/release must be increased to keep the two versions consistent.
# Ideally though, this spec will not change much or at all, so the version will
# just track the unsigned package's version/release.
#
# To populate these sources:
#   1. Build the unsigned packages as normal
#   2. Sign the desired binary
#   3. Place the unsigned package and signed binary in this spec's folder
#   4. Build this spec

Group:          Applications/System

%description -n hvloader
HvLoader.efi is an EFI application for loading an external hypervisor loader.

HvLoader.efi loads a given hypervisor loader binary (DLL, EFI, etc.), and 
calls it's entry point passing HvLoader.efi ImageHandle. This way the 
hypervisor loader binary has access to HvLoader.efi's command line options,
and use those as configuration parameters. The first HvLoader.efi command line
option is the path to hypervisor loader binary.

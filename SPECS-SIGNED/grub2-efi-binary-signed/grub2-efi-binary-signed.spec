Summary:        Signed GRand Unified Bootloader for %{buildarch} systems
Name:           grub2-efi-binary-signed-%{buildarch}
Version:        2.06~rc1
Release:        5%{?dist}

# This package's "version" and "release" must reflect the unsigned version that
# was signed.
# An important consequence is that when making a change to this package, the
# unsigned version/release must be increased to keep the two versions consistent.
# Ideally though, this spec will not change much or at all, so the version will
# just track the unsigned package's version/release.
#
# To populate these sources:
#   1. Build the unsigned packages as normal
#   2. Sign the desired binary
#   3. Place the unsigned package and signed binary in this spec's folder
#   4. Build this spec

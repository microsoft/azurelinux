# This spec purpose is to take an input kernel rpm and input secure-boot-signed
# kernel binary from the same build and generate a new "kernel" rpm with the
# signed kernel binary + all of the other original kernel files, triggers,
# scriptlets, requires, provides, etc.
#
# We need to ensure the kernel modules and kernel binary used are from the exact
# same build because at build time the kernel modules are signed with an
# ephemeral key that the kernel enrolls in its keyring. We enforce kernel
# module signature checking when we enable security features like kernel
# lockdown so our kernel can only load those specific kernel modules at runtime.
#
# Additionally, to complete the UEFI Secure Boot chain, we must PE-sign the
# kernel binary. Ideally we would enable secure-boot signing tools like pesign
# or sbsign to be callable from inside the rpmbuild environment, that way we can
# secure-boot sign the kernel binary during the kernel's rpmbuild. It is best
# practice to sign as soon as possible. However there are issues getting that
# secure boot signing infrastructure in place today. Hence we sign the
# resulting kernel binary and "repackage" the kernel RPM (something rpm itself
# actively tries to make sure you never do...generally for good reasons).
#
# To achive this repackaging, this spec creates a new subpackage named
# "kernel-mshv". To retain all of the initial kernel-mshv package behaviors, we make sure
# the subpackage has the same requires, provides, triggers, post steps, and
# files as the original kernel package.
#
# This specific repackaging implementation leaves room for us to enable the
# more ideal secure-boot signing flow in the future without introducing any
# sort of breaking change or new packaging. Users still install a "kernel-mshv"
# package like they normally would.
#
# Maintenance Notes:
# - This spec's "version" and "release" must reflect the unsigned version that
# was signed. An important consequence is that when making a change to this
# spec or the normal kernel spec, the other spec's version version/release must
# be increased to keep the two versions consistent.
#
# - Make sure the kernel subpackage's Requires, Provides, triggers, post/postun
# scriptlets, and files match the normal kernel-mshv spec's. The kernel subpackage
# should contain the same content as the input kernel package but replace the
# kernel binary with our signed kernel binary. Since all the requires, provides,
# etc are the same, this new kernel package can be a direct replacement for the
# normal kernel package and RPM will resolve packages with kernel dependencies
# correctly.
#
# To populate the input sources:
#   1. Build the unsigned packages as normal
#   2. Sign the desired binary
#   3. Place the unsigned package and signed binary in this spec's folder
#   4. Build this spec

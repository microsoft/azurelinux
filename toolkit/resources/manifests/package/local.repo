# This repo file is used by both the package fetcher as well as
# the package workers.
#
# For the fetcher, the repos' priority forces it to populate the cache
# (last in the list) by searching the repositories in the order defined below.
# The cache repo is empty during a clean build
# but allows avoiding network re-downloads during subsequent builds.
# Unless upstream repos are explcitly disabled, if a package is absent in
# all local repos defined in this file, the fetcher will access the network
# and search the official upstream repo and/or repos provided by the user.
#
# The package workers DO NOT access the network for the sake of satisfying
# package dependencies. They rely on the local repos defined below.

# We start with the toolchain packages even if they would overwrite
# the local ones, to guarantee a stable, known build environment.

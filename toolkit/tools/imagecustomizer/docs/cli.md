## --rpm-source=PATH

A resource that provides RPM files to be used during package installation.

Can be one of:

- Directory path: A path to a directory containing RPM files.

  The RPMs may either be in the directory itself or any subdirectories.

- `*.repo` file path: A path to a RPM repo definition file.

  The file name extension must be `.repo`.

  Note: This file is not installed in the image during customization.
  If that is also needed, then use `AdditionalFiles` to place the repo file within
  the image.

This option can be specified multiple times.

RPM sources are specified in the order or priority from lowest to highest.
If `--disable-base-image-rpm-repos` is not specified, then the in-built RPM repos are
given the lowest priority.

## --disable-base-image-rpm-repos

Disable the base image's installed RPM repos as a source of RPMs during package
installation.

## --log-level=LEVEL

Default: `info`

The verbosity of logs the tool outputs.

Higher levels of logging may be useful for debugging what the tool is doing.

The levels from lowest to highest level of verbosity are: `panic`, `fatal`, `error`,
`warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.

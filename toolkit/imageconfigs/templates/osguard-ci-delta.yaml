# The OS Guard Code Integrity image variant extends code integrity features
# beyond the host binaries, to include container images and their layers. This
# is achieved through configuring containerd to use erofs-snapshotter with
# dm-verity support and requiring dm-verity signature verification. On container
# execution, IPE will only allow the execution of containers that are dm-verity 
# verified.
#
# This file defines the delta (differences) to apply to the osguard-base.yaml
# template in order to generate the OS Guard Code Integrity (CI) image variant.
# This template is merged with the base template by the
# generate-osguard-imageconfigs.sh script to produce osguard-ci-amd64.yaml
# Only settings that differ from the base should be included here.

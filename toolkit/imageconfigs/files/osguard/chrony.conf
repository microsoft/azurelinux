# Welcome to the chrony configuration file. See chrony.conf(5) for more
# information about usable directives.
# Include configuration files found in /etc/chrony.conf.d.
confdir /etc/chrony.conf.d
# This will use (up to):
# - 4 sources from ntp.ubuntu.com which some are ipv6 enabled
# - 2 sources from 2.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org which is ipv6 enabled as well
# - 1 source from [01].ubuntu.pool.ntp.org each (ipv4 only atm)
# This means by default, up to 6 dual-stack and up to 2 additional IPv4-only
# sources will be used.
# At the same time it retains some protection against one of the entries being
# down (compare to just using one of the lines). See (LP: #1754358) for the
# discussion.
#
# About using servers from the NTP Pool Project in general see (LP: #104525).
# Approved by Ubuntu Technical Board on 2011-02-08.
# See http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html for more information.

# one second, with no limit to how many clock updates have occurred.

# leap-smeared time.
leapsectz right/UTC
# Azure hosts are synchronized to internal Microsoft time servers that
# take their time from Microsoft-owned Stratum 1 devices.  The Hyper-V
# drivers surface this time source as a PTP-based time source in the
# guest. This configures chrony to use it.  This also causes chronyd
# to require the /dev/ptp_hyperv device; chronyd will fail to start if
# it is not present. If this line is removed (so chronyd no longer
# uses the /dev/ptp_hyperv device), also remove (or comment out) the
# /etc/systemd/system/chronyd.service.d/wait-for-ptp-hyperv.conf file.

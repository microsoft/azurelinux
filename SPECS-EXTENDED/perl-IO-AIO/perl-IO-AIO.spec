%description
This module implements asynchronous I/O using whatever means your operating
system supports.

%package -n treescan
Summary:        Scan directory trees, list dirs/files, stat, sync, grep
Requires:       %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires:       perl(Pod::Usage)
BuildArch:      noarch

%description -n treescan
The treescan command scans directories and their contents recursively. By
default it lists all files and directories (with trailing /), but it can
optionally do various other things.

If no paths are given, treescan will use the current directory.

%changelog
* Thu Jan 27 2022 Pawel Winogrodzki <pawelwi@microsoft.com> - 4.76-2

- Update to 4.76

    syscall prototype that clashes with sys/syscall.h

- Update to 4.75
  - Added pidfd_open, pidfd_getfd and pidfd_send_signal functions

- Perl 5.32 rebuild

* Thu Jan 30 2020 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 4.72-4

- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_31_Mass_Rebuild

* Fri May 31 2019 Jitka Plesnikova <jplesnik@redhat.com> - 4.72-2
- Perl 5.30 rebuild

* Wed Apr  3 2019 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 4.72-1
- Update to 4.72
  - libeio: If fd 0 is available do not use it for aio_wd, as it collides with
    IO::AIO::CWD
  - Added IO::AIO::memfd_create
  - Correctly include <sys/uio.h> in the vmsplice test
  - Reduce code size by ~7%% on amd64 by declaring more functions as noinline
  - Documentation fixes and updates
  - Experimental and undocumented preliminary support for synchronous statx

* Sun Mar 10 2019 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 4.71-1
- Update to 4.71
  - Due to an error in the linux manpages, the configure tests for readahead,
    sync_file_range, splice etc. failed; this has been fixed

* Mon Mar  4 2019 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 4.70-1
- Update to 4.7
  - Significantly speed up scandir for the very special case of a non-POSIX
    filesystem that nevertheless reports valid dt_type information; the only
    known filesystem of this type is currently btrfs, which didn't get its act
    together to implement POSIX semantics in all these years
  - Add IO::AIO::MCL_ONFAULT for mlockall, add IO::AIO::mlockall
  - Neither sys/mkdev.h nor sys/sysmacros.h were included, even when they were
    detected by autoconf

* Fri Feb 01 2019 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 4.60-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_30_Mass_Rebuild

* Tue Aug 28 2018 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 4.60-1
- Update to 4.6
  - Add st_btime, st_btimesec, st_btimensec and st_gen accessors, mostly for
    bsds that expose birthtime and st_gen members (netbsd, freebsd but only
    st_gen on openbsd because they compiled their perl without support for
    birthtimes)
  - Fix madvise and munlock to properly support negative offsets
  - Allocate fd for the aio_close at boot time, to guarantee it working later,
    rather than calling abort when it fails; this also avoids close-on-exec
    race issues after module load
  - #undef utime on win32, which might help some reports of utime hangs
  - Minor documentation improvements
  - Minor configure clean-ups
  - Use $Config{perllibs} instead of libs for configure, which might help
    people who didn't install all perl dependencies (might break things as
    well)
- Remove buildreqs needed only due to use of $Config{libs}

* Wed Aug 15 2018 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 4.54-1
- Update to 4.54
  - Include sys/mkdev.h or sys/sysmacros.h if available
  - Further tweaks to configure invocation for systems requiring --rpath
  - No longer rely on custom paths on win32 platforms
  - Try to work around buggy PAGESIZE macro on solaris

* Tue Aug 14 2018 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 4.53-1
- Update to 4.53
  - Add $Config{libs} to LIBS for configure, to work around systems with broken
    library dependencies
- Add missing include for prctl()
- Add buildreqs needed due to overspecification of libraries in $Config{libs}

* Mon Aug 13 2018 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 4.52-1
- Update to 4.52
  - Complete rework of the autoconf framework: IO::AIO now uses its own
    config.h, separate from libeio, and tries to test the actual perl
    environment, not the standard system environment
  - Provide nanosecond-accuracy stat time accessors for both perl and IO::AIO
    stat functions
  - Removed non-portable C++ functions from eio.c
  - Try to fix readdir tests on cygwin spuriously failing

* Wed Aug  1 2018 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 4.50-1
- Update to 4.5
  - aio_mtouch: touch all pages as requested, not just the first page
  - New function: IO::AIO::mremap - linux-specific mremap, with constants
    MREMAP_MAYMOVE and MREMAP_FIXED
  - Add O_ACCMODE
  - Add (undocumented) MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC and SOCK_CLOEXEC constants

  - Add (experimental) IO::AIO::get_fdlimit and IO::AIO::min_fdlimit
  - Point out that aio_copy overwrites existing files
  - Remove filesystem magic number table from aio_statvfs docs as statvfs
    doesn't actually return this info at all (statfs does)
  - Add a bunch of (mostly linux-specific) constants for use in ioctls (see
    aio_ioctl docs)
  - treescan now has a proper manpage and useful --help output
  - New option --sync in treescan, to sync everything in a subtree
  - Changed default for aio_msync flags to MSYNC_SYNC
  - Document offset/length behaviour of mprotect/madvise

  - libeio: Use posix_close if available
  - libeio: Internal close() calls no longer disturb errno
  - Add IO:AIO::FALLOC_FL_UNSHARE
  - Update schmorp.h for removal of USE_SOCKETS_AS_HANDLES and better eventfd
    detection

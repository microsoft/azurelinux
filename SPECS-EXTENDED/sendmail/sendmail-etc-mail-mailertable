# The "mailer table" can be used to override routing for particular domains
# (which are not in class {w}, i.e. local host names). Uncomment either
# "hash" or "cdb". The "hash" requires libdb. If there is no libdb, use "cdb".
#
# hash /etc/mail/mailertable
# cdb /etc/mail/mailertable
#
# Keys in this database are fully qualified domain names or partial domains
# preceded by a dot -- for example, "vangogh.CS.Berkeley.EDU" or
# ".CS.Berkeley.EDU". As a special case of the latter, "." matches any domain
# not covered by other keys. Values must be of the form:
#
# mailer:domain
#
# where "mailer" is the internal mailer name, and "domain" is where to send
# the message. These maps are not reflected into the message header. As a
# special case, the forms:
#
# local:user
#
# will forward to the indicated user using the local mailer,
#
# local:
#
# will forward to the original user in the e-mail address using the local
# mailer, and
#
# error:code message
# error:D.S.N:code message
#
# will give an error message with the indicated SMTP reply code and message,
# where D.S.N is an RFC 1893 compliant error code.

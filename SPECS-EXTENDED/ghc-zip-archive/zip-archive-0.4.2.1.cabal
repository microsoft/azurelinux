Name:                zip-archive
Version:             0.4.2.1
Cabal-Version:       2.0
Build-type:          Simple
Synopsis:            Library for creating and modifying zip archives.
Description:
   The zip-archive library provides functions for creating, modifying, and
   extracting files from zip archives. The zip archive format is
   documented in <http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT>.
   .
   Certain simplifying assumptions are made about the zip archives: in
   particular, there is no support for strong encryption, zip files that
   span multiple disks, ZIP64, OS-specific file attributes, or compression
   methods other than Deflate. However, the library should be able to read
   the most common zip archives, and the archives it produces should be
   readable by all standard unzip programs.
   .
   Archives are built and extracted in memory, so manipulating large zip
   files will consume a lot of memory. If you work with large zip files or
   need features not supported by this library, a better choice may be
   <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/zip zip>, which uses a
   memory-efficient streaming approach. However, zip can only read and
   write archives inside instances of MonadIO, so zip-archive is a better
   choice if you want to manipulate zip archives in "pure" contexts.
   .
   As an example of the use of the library, a standalone zip archiver and
   extracter is provided in the source distribution.

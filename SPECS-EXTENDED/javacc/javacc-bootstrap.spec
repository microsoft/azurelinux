%description
Java Compiler Compiler (JavaCC) is the most popular parser generator
for use with Java applications. A parser generator is a tool that reads
a grammar specification and converts it to a Java program that can
recognize matches to the grammar. In addition to the parser generator
itself, JavaCC provides other standard capabilities related to parser
generation such as tree building (via a tool called JJTree included
with JavaCC), actions, debugging, etc.

NOTE: this is only a bootstrap package enabling the build of proper JavaCC!
Please install '%{base_name}' if you're looking for JavaCC.

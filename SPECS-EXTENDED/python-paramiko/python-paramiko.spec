%global paramiko_desc \
Paramiko (a combination of the Esperanto words for "paranoid" and "friend") is\
a module for python 2.3 or greater that implements the SSH2 protocol for secure\
(encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. Unlike SSL (aka\
TLS), the SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates signed by a\
powerful central authority. You may know SSH2 as the protocol that replaced\
telnet and rsh for secure access to remote shells, but the protocol also\
includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across an\
encrypted tunnel (this is how sftp works, for example).

%changelog
* Tue Feb  4 2025 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 3.5.1-1
- Update to 3.5.1 (rhbz#2343673)
  - Private key material is now explicitly 'unpadded' during decryption,
    removing a reliance on some lax OpenSSL behavior and making us compatible
    with future Cryptography releases (GH#2490)

* Sat Jan 18 2025 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 3.5.0-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_42_Mass_Rebuild

* Mon Sep 16 2024 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 3.5.0-1
- Update to 3.5.0 (rhbz#2312503)
  - Add support for AES-GCM encryption ciphers (128 and 256 bit variants)
    (GH#982, GH#2157, GH#2444, rhbz#2311855); this functionality has been
    tested in client mode against OpenSSH 9.0, 9.2 and 9.6, as well as against
    a number of proprietary appliance SSH servers
  - Check for 'None' transport members inside '~paramiko.channel.Channel' when
    closing the channel; this likely doesn't come up much in the real world,
    but was causing warnings in the test suite

* Mon Aug 12 2024 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 3.4.1-1
- Update to 3.4.1
  - Massage our import of the TripleDES cipher to support Cryptography ≥ 43;
    this should prevent 'CryptographyDeprecationWarning' from appearing upon
    import (GH#2419, GH#2421)
  - Modify a test-harness skiptest check to work with newer versions of
    Cryptography (GH#2420)

* Mon Jan 22 2024 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 3.4.0-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_40_Mass_Rebuild

* Tue Dec 19 2023 Gwyn Ciesla <gwync@protonmail.com> - 3.4.0-1
- 3.4.0
  - 'Transport' grew a new 'packetizer_class' kwarg for overriding the
    packet-handler class used internally (mostly for testing, but advanced
    users may find this useful when doing deep hacks)
  - Address CVE 2023-48795 (https://terrapin-attack.com/) a.k.a. the "Terrapin
    Attack", a vulnerability found in the SSH protocol re: treatment of packet
    sequence numbers) as follows:
    - The vulnerability only impacts encrypt-then-MAC digest algorithms in
      tandem with CBC ciphers, and ChaCha20-poly1305; of these, Paramiko
      currently only implements 'hmac-sha2-(256|512)-etm' in tandem with
      'AES-CBC'; if you are unable to upgrade to Paramiko versions containing
      the below fixes right away, you may instead use the 'disabled_algorithms'
      connection option to disable the ETM MACs and/or the CBC ciphers (this
      option is present in Paramiko ≥ 2.6)
    - As the fix for the vulnerability requires both ends of the connection to
      cooperate, the below changes will only take effect when the remote end is
      OpenSSH ≥ 9.6 (or equivalent, such as Paramiko in server mode, as of this
      patch version) and configured to use the new "strict kex" mode (Paramiko
      will always attempt to use "strict kex" mode if offered by the server,
      unless you override this by specifying 'strict_kex=False' in
      'Transport.__init__')
    - Paramiko will now raise an 'SSHException' subclass ('MessageOrderError')
      when protocol messages are received in unexpected order; this includes
      situations like receiving 'MSG_DEBUG' or 'MSG_IGNORE' during initial key
      exchange, which are no longer allowed during strict mode
    - Key (re)negotiation -- i.e. 'MSG_NEWKEYS', whenever it is encountered --
      now resets packet sequence numbers (this should be invisible to users
      during normal operation, only causing exceptions if the exploit is
      encountered, which will usually result in, again, 'MessageOrderError')
    - Sequence number rollover will now raise 'SSHException' if it occurs
      during initial key exchange (regardless of strict mode status)
  - Tweak 'ext-info-(c|s)' detection during KEXINIT protocol phase; the
    original implementation made assumptions based on an OpenSSH implementation
    detail

* Sun Jul 30 2023 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 3.3.1-1
- Update to 3.3.1 (rhbz#2227478)
  - Cleaned up some very old root level files, mostly just to exercise some of
    our doc build and release machinery

* Fri Jul 28 2023 Gwyn Ciesla <gwync@protonmail.com> - 3.3.0-1
- 3.3.0
  - Add support and tests for 'Match final ..' (frequently used in ProxyJump
    configurations to exclude the jump host) to our SSH config parser (GH#1907,
    GH#1992)
  - Add an explicit 'max_concurrent_prefetch_requests' argument to
    'paramiko.client.SSHClient.get' and 'paramiko.client.SSHClient.getfo',
    allowing users to limit the number of concurrent requests used during
    prefetch (GH#1587, GH#2058)

* Fri Jul 21 2023 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 3.2.0-3
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_39_Mass_Rebuild

* Thu Jun 15 2023 Python Maint <python-maint@redhat.com> - 3.2.0-2
- Rebuilt for Python 3.12

* Sat May 27 2023 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 3.2.0-1
- Update to 3.2.0 (rhbz#2210398)
  - Fixed a very sneaky bug found at the apparently rarely-traveled
    intersection of RSA-SHA2 keys, certificates, SSH agents, and
    stricter-than-OpenSSH server targets, which manifested as yet another
    "well, if we turn off SHA2 at one end or another, everything works again"
    problem, for example with version 12 of the Teleport server endpoint
  - The 'server-sig-algs' and 'RSA-SHA2' features added around Paramiko 2.9 or
    so, had the annoying side effect of not working with servers that don't
    support *either* of those feature sets, requiring use of
    'disabled_algorithms' to forcibly disable the SHA2 algorithms on Paramiko's
    end (GH#1961, GH#2012 and countless others)
    - The *experimental* '~paramiko.transport.ServiceRequestingTransport' (noted
      in its own entry in this changelog) includes a fix for this issue,
      specifically by falling back to the same algorithm as the in-use pubkey if
      it's in the algorithm list (leaving the "first algorithm in said list" as
      an absolute final fallback)
  - Implement '_fields()' on '~paramiko.agent.AgentKey' so that it may be
    compared (via '==') with other '~paramiko.pkey.PKey' instances
  - Since its inception, Paramiko has (for reasons lost to time) implemented
    authentication as a side effect of handling affirmative replies to
    'MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST' protocol messages; what this means is Paramiko makes
    one such request before every 'MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST', i.e. every auth
    attempt (GH#23)
    - OpenSSH doesn't care if clients send multiple service requests, but other
      server implementations are often stricter in what they accept after an
      initial service request (due to the RFCs not being clear), which can
      result in odd behavior when a user doesn't authenticate successfully on
      the very first try (for example, when the right key for a target host is
      the third in one's ssh-agent)
    - This version of Paramiko now contains an opt-in
      '~paramiko.transport.Transport' subclass,
      '~paramiko.transport.ServiceRequestingTransport', which more-correctly
      implements service request handling in the Transport, and uses an
      auth-handler subclass internally that has been similarly adapted; users
      wanting to try this new experimental code path may hand this class to
      'SSHClient.connect` as its 'transport_factory' kwarg
    - This feature is *EXPERIMENTAL* and its code may be subject to change
    - Minor backwards incompatible changes exist in the new code paths, most
      notably the removal of the (inconsistently applied and rarely used)
      'event' arguments to the 'auth_xxx' methods
    - GSSAPI support has only been partially implemented, and is untested
    - Some minor backwards-*compatible* changes were made to the *existing*
      Transport and AuthHandler classes to facilitate the new code; for
      example, 'Transport._handler_table' and
      'AuthHandler._client_handler_table' are now properties instead of raw
      attributes
  - Users of '~paramiko.client.SSHClient' can now configure the authentication
    logic Paramiko uses when connecting to servers; this functionality is
    intended for advanced users and higher-level libraries such as 'Fabric'
    (https://fabfile.org/); see '~paramiko.auth_strategy' for details (GH#387)
    - Fabric's co-temporal release includes a proof-of-concept use of this
      feature, implementing an auth flow much closer to that of the OpenSSH
      client (versus Paramiko's legacy behavior); it is *strongly recommended*
      that if this interests you, investigate replacing any direct use of
      'SSHClient' with Fabric's 'Connection'
    - This feature is **EXPERIMENTAL**; please see its docs for details
  - Enhanced '~paramiko.agent.AgentKey' with new attributes, such as:
    - Added a 'comment' attribute (and constructor argument);
      'Agent.get_keys()' now uses this kwarg to store any comment field sent
      over by the agent; the original version of the agent feature inexplicably
      did not store the comment anywhere
    - Agent-derived keys now attempt to instantiate a copy of the appropriate
      key class for access to other algorithm-specific members (e.g. key size);
      this is available as the '.inner_key' attribute
      - This functionality is now in use in Fabric's new '--list-agent-keys'
        feature, as well as in Paramiko's debug logging
  - '~paramiko.pkey.PKey' now offers convenience "meta-constructors", static
    methods that simplify the process of instantiating the correct subclass for
    a given key input
    - For example, 'PKey.from_path' can load a file path without knowing
      *a priori* what type of key it is (thanks to some handy methods within
      our cryptography dependency); going forwards, we expect this to be the
      primary method of loading keys by user code that runs on "human time"
      (i.e. where some minor efficiencies are worth the convenience)
    - In addition, 'PKey.from_type_string' now exists, and is being used in
      some internals to load ssh-agent keys
    - As part of these changes, '~paramiko.pkey.PKey' and friends grew a
      '~paramiko.pkey.PKey.identifiers' classmethod; this is inspired by the
      '~paramiko.ecdsakey.ECDSAKey.supported_key_format_identifiers' classmethod
      (which now refers to the new method); this also includes adding a '.name'
      attribute to most key classes (which will eventually replace
      '.get_name()')
  - '~paramiko.pkey.PKey' grew a new '.algorithm_name' property that displays
    the key algorithm; this is typically derived from the value of
    '~paramiko.pkey.PKey.get_name'; for example, ED25519 keys have a 'get_name'
    of 'ssh-ed25519' (the SSH protocol key type field value), and now have a
    'algorithm_name' of 'ED25519'
  - '~paramiko.pkey.PKey' grew a new '.fingerprint' property that emits a
    fingerprint string matching the SHA256+Base64 values printed by various
    OpenSSH tooling (e.g. 'ssh-add -l', 'ssh -v'); this is intended to help
    troubleshoot Paramiko-vs-OpenSSH behavior and will eventually replace the
    venerable 'get_fingerprint' method
  - '~paramiko.agent.AgentKey' had a dangling Python 3 incompatible '__str__'
    method returning bytes; this method has been removed, allowing the
    superclass' ('~paramiko.pkey.PKey') method to run instead

* Sun Mar 12 2023 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 3.1.0-1
- Update to 3.1.0 (rhbz#2177436)
  - Add an explicit 'channel_timeout' keyword argument to
    'paramiko.client.SSHClient.connect', allowing users to configure the
     previously-hardcoded default value of 3600 seconds (GH#2009, GH#2013, and
     others)
  - Accept single tabs as field separators (in addition to single spaces) in
    'paramiko.hostkeys.HostKeyEntry.from_line' for parity with OpenSSH's
    KnownHosts parser (GH#2173)
  - Apply 'codespell' to the codebase, which found a lot of very old minor
    spelling mistakes in docstrings; also, modernize many instances of '*largs'
    vs. '*args' and '**kwarg' vs. '**kwargs' (GH#2178)

* Sun Jan 22 2023 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 3.0.0-1
- Update to 3.0.0 (rhbz#2162914)
  - Remove some unnecessary '__repr__' calls when handling bytes-vs-str
    conversions; this was apparently doing a lot of unintentional data
    processing, which adds up in some use cases, such as SFTP transfers,
    which may now be significantly faster (GH#2110)
  - Streamline some redundant (and costly) byte conversion calls in the
    packetizer and the core SFTP module; this should lead to some SFTP
    speedups at the very least (GH#2165)
  - 'paramiko.util.retry_on_signal' (and any internal uses of same, and also
    any internal retries of 'EINTR' on e.g. socket operations) has been
    removed; as of Python 3.5, per PEP 475 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0475/),
    this functionality (and retrying 'EINTR' generally) is now part of the
    standard library
    Note: This change is backwards incompatible if you were explicitly
    importing/using this particular function; the observable behavior otherwise
    should not be changing
  - '~paramiko.config.SSHConfig' used to straight-up delete the 'proxycommand'
    key from config lookup results when the source config said
    'ProxyCommand none'; this has been altered to preserve the key and give it
    the Python value 'None', thus making the Python representation more in line
    with the source config file
    Note: This change is backwards incompatible if you were relying on the old
    (1.x, 2.x) behavior for some reason (e.g. assuming all 'proxycommand'
    values were valid subcommand strings)
  - The behavior of private key classes' (i.e. anything inheriting from
    '~paramiko.pkey.PKey') private key writing methods used to perform a
    manual, extra 'chmod' call after writing; this hasn't been strictly
    necessary since the mid 2.x release line (when key writing started giving
    the 'mode' argument to 'os.open'), and has now been removed entirely; this
    should only be observable if you were mocking Paramiko's system calls
    during your own testing, or similar
  - 'PKey.__cmp__' has been removed - ordering-oriented comparison of key files
    is unlikely to have ever made sense (the old implementation attempted to
    order by the hashes of the key material) and so we have not bothered
    setting up '__lt__' and friends at this time; the class continues to have
    its original '__eq__' untouched
    Note: This change is backwards incompatible if you were actually trying to
    sort public key objects (directly or indirectly); please file bug reports
    detailing your use case if you have some intractable need for this
    behavior, and we'll consider adding back the necessary Python 3 magic
    methods so that it works as before
  - A handful of lower-level classes (notably 'paramiko.message.Message' and
    'paramiko.pkey.PKey') previously returned 'bytes' objects from their
    implementation of '__str__', even under Python 3; and there was never any
    '__bytes__' method; these issues have been fixed by renaming '__str__' to
    '__bytes__' and relying on Python's default "stringification returns the
    output of '__repr__'" behavior re: any real attempts to 'str()' such objects
  - 'paramiko.common.asbytes' has been moved to 'paramiko.util.asbytes'
    Note: This change is backwards incompatible if you were directly using this
    function (which is unlikely)
  - Remove the now irrelevant 'paramiko.py3compat' module
    Note: This change is backwards incompatible - such references should be
    search-and-replaced with their modern Python 3.6+ equivalents; in some
    cases, still-useful methods or values have been moved to 'paramiko.util'
    (most) or 'paramiko.common' ('byte_*')
  - Drop support for Python versions less than 3.6, including Python 2; so long
    and thanks for all the fish! Our packaging metadata has been updated to
    include 'python_requires', so this should not cause breakage unless you're
    on an old installation method that can't read this metadata
    Note: As part of this change, our dependencies have been updated; e.g. we
    now require Cryptography>=3.3, up from 2.5

* Fri Jan 20 2023 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 2.12.0-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_38_Mass_Rebuild

* Sun Nov  6 2022 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.12.0-1
- Update to 2.12.0 (rhbz#2140281)
  - Add a 'transport_factory' kwarg to 'SSHClient.connect' for advanced users
    to gain more control over early Transport setup and manipulation (GH#2054,
    GH#2125)
  - Update '~paramiko.client.SSHClient' so it explicitly closes its wrapped
    socket object upon encountering socket errors at connection time; this
    should help somewhat with certain classes of memory leaks, resource
    warnings, and/or errors (though we hasten to remind everyone that Client
    and Transport have their own '.close()' methods for use in non-error
    situations!) (GH#1822)
  - Raise '~paramiko.ssh_exception.SSHException' explicitly when blank private
    key data is loaded, instead of the natural result of 'IndexError'; this
    should help more bits of Paramiko or Paramiko-adjacent codebases to
    correctly handle this class of error (GH#1599, GH#1637)
- Use SPDX-format license tag

* Fri Jul 22 2022 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 2.11.0-3
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_37_Mass_Rebuild

* Tue Jun 14 2022 Python Maint <python-maint@redhat.com> - 2.11.0-2
- Rebuilt for Python 3.11

* Tue May 17 2022 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.11.0-1
- Update to 2.11.0
  - Align signature verification algorithm with OpenSSH re: zero-padding
    signatures that don't match their nominal size/length; this shouldn't
    affect most users, but will help Paramiko-implemented SSH servers handle
    poorly behaved clients such as PuTTY (GH#1933)
  - OpenSSH 7.7 and older has a bug preventing it from understanding how to
    perform SHA2 signature verification for RSA certificates (specifically
    certs - not keys), so when we added SHA2 support it broke all clients using
    RSA certificates with these servers; this has been fixed in a manner similar
    to what OpenSSH's own client does - a version check is performed and the
    algorithm used is downgraded if needed (GH#2017)
  - Recent versions of Cryptography have deprecated Blowfish algorithm support;
    in lieu of an easy method for users to remove it from the list of
    algorithms Paramiko tries to import and use, we've decided to remove it
    from our "preferred algorithms" list, which will both discourage use of a
    weak algorithm, and avoid warnings (GH#2038, GH#2039)
  - Windows-native SSH agent support as merged in 2.10 could encounter
    'Errno 22' 'OSError' exceptions in some scenarios (e.g. server not cleanly
    closing a relevant named pipe); this has been worked around and should be
    less problematic (GH#2008, GH#2010)
  - Add SSH config token expansion (eg '%%h', '%%p') when parsing 'ProxyJump'
    directives (GH#1951)
  - Apply unittest 'skipIf' to tests currently using SHA1 in their critical
    path, to avoid failures on systems starting to disable SHA1 outright in
    their crypto backends (e.g. RHEL 9) (GH#2004, GH#2011)

* Tue Apr 26 2022 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.10.4-1
- Update to 2.10.4
  - Update 'camelCase' method calls against the 'threading' module to be
    'snake_case'; this and related tweaks should fix some deprecation warnings
    under Python 3.10 (GH#1838, GH#1870, GH#2028)
  - '~paramiko.pkey.PKey' instances' '__eq__' did not have the usual safety
    guard in place to ensure they were being compared to another 'PKey' object,
    causing occasional spurious 'BadHostKeyException', among other things
    (GH#1964, GH#2023, GH#2024)
  - Servers offering certificate variants of hostkey algorithms (e.g.
    'ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com') could not have their host keys verified by
    Paramiko clients, as it only ever considered non-cert key types for that
    part of connection handshaking (GH#2035)

* Mon Mar 21 2022 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.10.3-2
- Skip tests that would fail without SHA-1 signing support in backend, such as
  on EL-9 (GH#2011)

* Sat Mar 19 2022 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.10.3-1
- Update to 2.10.3
  - Certificate-based pubkey auth was inadvertently broken when adding SHA2
    support in version 2.9.0 (GH#1963, GH#1977)
  - Switch from module-global to thread-local storage when recording thread IDs
    for a logging helper; this should avoid one flavor of memory leak for
    long-running processes (GH#2002, GH#2003)

* Tue Mar 15 2022 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.10.2-1
- Update to 2.10.2
  - Fix Python 2 compatibility breakage introduced in 2.10.1 (GH#2001)
- Re-enable sftp tests, no longer failing under mock

* Sun Mar 13 2022 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.10.1-1
- Update to 2.10.1
  - CVE-2022-24302: Creation of new private key files using
    '~paramiko.pkey.PKey' subclasses was subject to a race condition between
    file creation and mode modification, which could be exploited by an
    attacker with knowledge of where the Paramiko-using code would write out
    such files; this has been patched by using 'os.open' and 'os.fdopen' to
    ensure new files are opened with the correct mode immediately (we've left
    the subsequent explicit 'chmod' in place to minimize any possible
    disruption, though it may get removed in future backwards-incompatible
    updates)
  - Add support for the '%%C' token when parsing SSH config files (GH#1976)
  - Add support for OpenSSH's Windows agent as a fallback when Putty/WinPageant
    isn't available or functional (GH#1509, GH#1837, GH#1868)
  - Significantly speed up low-level read/write actions on
    '~paramiko.sftp_file.SFTPFile' objects by using 'bytearray'/'memoryview'
    (GH#892); this is unlikely to change anything for users of the higher level
    methods like 'SFTPClient.get' or 'SFTPClient.getfo', but users of
    'SFTPClient.open' will likely see orders of magnitude improvements for
    files larger than a few megabytes in size
  - Add 'six' explicitly to install-requires; it snuck into active use at some
    point but has only been indicated by transitive dependency on 'bcrypt'
    until they somewhat-recently dropped it (GH#1985); this will be short-lived
    until we drop Python 2 support

* Fri Jan 21 2022 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 2.9.2-3
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_36_Mass_Rebuild

* Fri Jan 14 2022 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.9.2-2
- Avoid use of deprecated python-mock by using unittest.mock instead
  https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/pull/1666

* Sat Jan  8 2022 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.9.2-1
- Update to 2.9.2
  - Connecting to servers that support 'server-sig-algs' but which have no
    overlap between that list and what a Paramiko client supports, now raise
    an exception instead of defaulting to 'rsa-sha2-512' (since the use of
    'server-sig-algs' allows us to know what the server supports)
  - Enhanced log output when connecting to servers that do not support
    'server-sig-algs' extensions, making the new-as-of-2.9 defaulting to SHA2
    pubkey algorithms more obvious when it kicks in

* Sat Dec 25 2021 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.9.1-1
- Update to 2.9.1
  - Server-side support for 'rsa-sha2-256' and 'ssh-rsa' wasn't fully operable
    after 2.9.0's release (signatures for RSA pubkeys were always run through
    'rsa-sha2-512' instead) (GH#1935)

* Fri Dec 24 2021 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.9.0-1
- Update to 2.9.0
  - Add support for SHA-2 variants of RSA key verification algorithms (as
    described in RFC 8332) as well as limited SSH extension negotiation (RFC
    8308) (GH#1326, GH#1643, GH#1644, GH#1925)
    How SSH servers/clients decide when and how to use this functionality can be
    complicated; Paramiko's support is as follows:
    - Client verification of server host key during key exchange will now prefer
      rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256, and legacy ssh-rsa algorithms, in that order,
      instead of just ssh-rsa
    - Note that the preference order of other algorithm families such as
      ed25519 and ecdsa has not changed; for example, those two groups are still
      preferred over RSA
    - Server mode will now offer all 3 RSA algorithms for host key verification
      during key exchange, similar to client mode, if it has been configured
      with an RSA host key
    - Client mode key exchange now sends the ext-info-c flag signaling support
      for MSG_EXT_INFO, and support for parsing the latter (specifically, its
      server-sig-algs flag) has been added
    - Client mode, when performing public key authentication with an RSA key or
      cert, will act as follows:
      - In all cases, the list of algorithms to consider is based on the new
        preferred_pubkeys list and disabled_algorithms; this list, like with
        host keys, prefers SHA2-512, SHA2-256 and SHA1, in that order
      - When the server does not send server-sig-algs, Paramiko will attempt
        the first algorithm in the above list; clients connecting to legacy
        servers should thus use disabled_algorithms to turn off SHA2
      - When the server does send server-sig-algs, the first algorithm
        supported by both ends is used, or if there is none, it falls back to
        the previous behavior
    - SSH agent support grew the ability to specify algorithm flags when
      requesting private key signatures; this is now used to forward SHA2
      algorithms when appropriate
    - Server mode is now capable of pubkey auth involving SHA-2 signatures from
      clients, provided one's server implementation actually provides for doing
      so; this includes basic support for sending MSG_EXT_INFO (containing
      server-sig-algs only) to clients advertising ext-info-c in their key
      exchange list
    In order to implement the above, the following API additions were made:
    - 'PKey.sign_ssh_data <paramiko.pkey.PKey>': Grew an extra, optional
      'algorithm' keyword argument (defaulting to 'None' for most subclasses,
      and to "ssh-rsa" for '~paramiko.rsakey.RSAKey')
    - A new '~paramiko.ssh_exception.SSHException' subclass was added,
      '~paramiko.ssh_exception.IncompatiblePeer', and is raised in all spots
      where key exchange aborts due to algorithmic incompatibility; like all
      other exceptions in that module, it inherits from 'SSHException', and as
      nothing else was changed about the raising (i.e. the attributes and
      message text are the same) this change is backwards compatible
    - '~paramiko.transport.Transport' grew a '_preferred_pubkeys' attribute and
      matching 'preferred_pubkeys' property to match the other, kex-focused,
      such members; this allows client pubkey authentication to honor the
      'disabled_algorithms' feature

* Mon Nov 29 2021 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.8.1-1
- Update to 2.8.1
  - Fix listdir failure when server uses a locale (GH#985, GH#992); now on
    Python 2.7 SFTPAttributes will decode abbreviated month names correctly
    rather than raise 'UnicodeDecodeError'
  - Deleting items from '~paramiko.hostkeys.HostKeys' would incorrectly raise
    'KeyError' even for valid keys, due to a logic bug (GH#1024)
  - Update RSA and ECDSA key decoding subroutines to correctly catch exception
    types thrown by modern versions of Cryptography (specifically 'TypeError'
    and its internal 'UnsupportedAlgorithm') (GH#1257, GH#1266); these
    exception classes will now become '~paramiko.ssh_exception.SSHException'
    instances instead of bubbling up
  - Update '~paramiko.pkey.PKey' and subclasses to compare ('__eq__') via
    direct field/attribute comparison instead of hashing (while retaining the
    existing behavior of '__hash__' via a slight refactor) (GH#908)
    Warning:
    This fixes a security flaw! If you are running Paramiko on 32-bit systems
    with low entropy (such as any 32-bit Python 2, or a 32-bit Python 3 that is
    running with 'PYTHONHASHSEED=0') it is possible for an attacker to craft a
    new keypair from an exfiltrated public key, which Paramiko would consider
    equal to the original key.
    This could enable attacks such as, but not limited to, the following:
    - Paramiko server processes would incorrectly authenticate the attacker
      (using their generated private key) as if they were the victim. We see
      this as the most plausible attack using this flaw.
    - Paramiko client processes would incorrectly validate a connected server
      (when host key verification is enabled) while subjected to a
      man-in-the-middle attack. This impacts more users than the server-side
      version, but also carries higher requirements for the attacker, namely
      successful DNS poisoning or other MITM techniques.

* Mon Oct 11 2021 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.8.0-1
- Update to 2.8.0
  - Administrivia overhaul, including but not limited to:
    - Migrate CI to CircleCI
    - Primary dev branch is now 'main' (renamed)
    - Many README edits for clarity, modernization etc.; including a bunch more
      (and consistent) status badges and unification with main project site
      index
    - PyPI page much more fleshed out (long_description is now filled in with
      the README; sidebar links expanded; etc.)
    - flake8, pytest configs split out of setup.cfg into their own files
    - Invoke/invocations (used by maintainers/contributors) upgraded to modern
      versions
  - Newer server-side key exchange algorithms not intended to use SHA1
    (diffie-hellman-group14-sha256, diffie-hellman-group16-sha512) were
    incorrectly using SHA1 after all, due to a bug causing them to ignore the
    'hash_algo' class attribute; this has been corrected (GH#1452, GH#1882)
  - Add a 'prefetch' keyword argument to 'SFTPClient.get'/'SFTPClient.getfo' so
    that users who need to skip SFTP prefetching are able to conditionally turn
    it off (GH#1846)

  - Remove leading whitespace from OpenSSH RSA test suite static key fixture,
    to conform better to spec. (GH#1722)
  - Fix incorrect string formatting causing unhelpful error message annotation
    when using Kerberos/GSSAPI
  - Fix incorrectly swapped order of 'p' and 'q' numbers when loading
    OpenSSH-format RSA private keys; at minimum this should address a slowdown
    when using such keys, and it also means Paramiko works with Cryptography
    3.1 and above, which complains strenuously when this problem appears

- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_32_Mass_Rebuild

* Wed Dec 11 2019 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.7.1-1
- Update to 2.7.1
  - The new-style private key format (added in 2.7.0) suffered from an
    unpadding bug that had been fixed earlier for Ed25519 (as that key type has
    always used the newer format); that fix has been refactored and applied to
    the base key class (GH#1567)
  - Fix a bug in support for ECDSA keys under the newly-supported OpenSSH key
    format (GH#1565, GH#1566)

* Wed Dec  4 2019 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.7.0-1
- Update to 2.7.0
  - Implement support for OpenSSH 6.5-style private key files (typically
    denoted as having 'BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY' headers instead of PEM
    format's 'BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY' or similar); if you were getting any sort
    of weird auth error from "modern" keys generated on newer operating system
    releases (such as macOS Mojave), this is the first update to try (GH#602,
    GH#618, GH#1313, GH#1343)
  - Token expansion in 'ssh_config' used a different method of determining the
    local username ('$USER' environment variable), compared to what the (much
    older) client connection code does ('getpass.getuser', which includes
    '$USER' but may check other variables first, and is generally much more
    comprehensive); both modules now use 'getpass.getuser'
  - A couple of outright '~paramiko.config.SSHConfig' parse errors were
    previously represented as vanilla 'Exception' instances; as part of recent
    feature work a more specific exception class,
    '~paramiko.ssh_exception.ConfigParseError', has been created; it is now
    also used in those older spots, which is naturally backwards compatible
  - Implement support for the 'Match' keyword in 'ssh_config' files;
    previously, this keyword was simply ignored and keywords inside such blocks
    were treated as if they were part of the previous block (GH#717)
    - Note: this feature adds a new optional install dependency 'Invoke'
      (https://www.pyinvoke.org), for managing 'Match exec' subprocesses
  - Additional installation 'extras_require' "flavors" ('ed25519', 'invoke',
    and 'all') have been added to our packaging metadata
  - Paramiko's use of 'subprocess' for 'ProxyCommand' support is conditionally
    imported to prevent issues on limited interpreter platforms like Google
    Compute Engine; however, any resulting 'ImportError' was lost instead of
    preserved for raising (in the rare cases where a user tried leveraging
    'ProxyCommand' in such an environment); this has been fixed
  - Perform deduplication of 'IdentityFile' contents during 'ssh_config'
    parsing; previously, if your config would result in the same value being
    encountered more than once, 'IdentityFile' would contain that many copies
    of the same string
  - Implement most 'canonical hostname' 'ssh_config' functionality
    ('CanonicalizeHostname', 'CanonicalDomains', 'CanonicalizeFallbackLocal',
    and 'CanonicalizeMaxDots'; 'CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs' has *not* yet
    been implemented) - all were previously silently ignored (GH#897)
  - Explicitly document which ssh_config features we currently support;
    previously users just had to guess, which is simply no good
  - Add new convenience classmethod constructors to
    '~paramiko.config.SSHConfig': '~paramiko.config.SSHConfig.from_text',
    '~paramiko.config.SSHConfig.from_file', and
    '~paramiko.config.SSHConfig.from_path'; no more annoying two-step process!
- Add Recommends: of python3-invoke and python3-pyasn1 for optional
  functionality

* Thu Jun 27 2019 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.6.0-1
- Update to 2.6.0
  - Add a new keyword argument to 'SSHClient.connect' and
    '~paramiko.transport.Transport', 'disabled_algorithms', which allows
    selectively disabling one or more kex/key/cipher/etc algorithms; this can
    be useful when disabling algorithms your target server (or client) does not
    support cleanly, or to work around unpatched bugs in Paramiko's own
    implementation thereof (GH#1463)
  - Tweak many exception classes so their string representations are more
    human-friendly; this also includes incidental changes to some 'super()'
    calls (GH#1440, GH#1460)
  - Add backwards-compatible support for the 'gssapi' GSSAPI library, as the
    previous backend ('python-gssapi') has become defunct (GH#584, GH#1166,
    GH#1311)
  - 'SSHClient.exec_command' now returns a new subclass,
    '~paramiko.channel.ChannelStdinFile', rather than a naïve
    '~paramiko.channel.ChannelFile' object for its 'stdin' value, which fixes
    issues such as hangs when running remote commands that read from stdin
    (GH#322)
- Drop gssapi patch as it's no longer needed
- Drop pytest-relaxed patch as it's no longer needed

* Thu Jun 27 2019 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.5.1-1

    using SHA512)
  - Add support for Curve25519 key exchange
  - Raise Cryptography dependency requirement to version 2.5 (from 1.5) and
    update some deprecated uses of its API
  - Add support for the modern (as of Python 3.3) import location of
    'MutableMapping' (used in host key management) to avoid the old location
    becoming deprecated in Python 3.8
- Drop hard dependency on pyasn1 as it's only needed for optional GSSAPI
  functionality

* Tue Oct  9 2018 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 2.4.2-1
- Update to 2.4.2
  - Fix exploit (GH#1283, CVE-2018-1000805) in Paramiko’s server mode (not
    client mode) where hostile clients could trick the server into thinking
    they were authenticated without actually submitting valid authentication
  - Modify protocol message handling such that Transport does not respond to
    MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED with its own MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED; this behavior probably
    didn’t cause any outright errors, but it doesn’t seem to conform to the
    RFCs and could cause (non-infinite) feedback loops in some scenarios
    (usually those involving Paramiko on both ends)
  - Add *.pub files to the MANIFEST so distributed source packages contain
    some necessary test assets (GH#1262)

    (this does not impact client use) where authentication status was not
    checked before processing channel-open and other requests typically only
    sent after authenticating
  - Ed25519 auth key decryption raised an unexpected exception when given a

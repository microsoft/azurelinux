# The X server provides capabilities of the form:

# Provides: xserver-abi(ansic-0) = 4
#
# for an ABI version of 0.4.  The major number is encoded into the name so
# that major number changes force upgrades.  If we didn't, then
#
# Requires: xserver-abi(ansic) >= 0.4
#
# would also match 1.0, which is wrong since major numbers mean an ABI break.

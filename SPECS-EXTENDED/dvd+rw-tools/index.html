<TR VALIGN="top" ALIGN="justify">
<TD>A.	<TD>DVD+RW (but not DVD+R nor any DVD-dash) is a true random
	write access media and therefore is suitable for housing of an
	arbitrary file system, e.g. <B>udf,</B> vfat, ext2, etc. This,

	implementation. <I>However,</I> I have to recommend to
	<B>deploy it with caution</B>, see <A HREF="#udf">tutorial</A>
	for further details. Also note that not all OEMs seem to live
	up to the promise of true random write access. As for the
	moment of this writing apparenly only 2nd generation
	Ricoh-based units (see <A
	HREF="http://www.dvdplusrw.org/">dvdplusrw.org</A> for
	generation listings) equipped with later firmware can sustain

	<A HREF="-RW/">-R[W]</A>.</B> I could simply refer to the
	tutorial below, but figured that couple of words about the
	[original] design ideas behind <B>growisofs, the principal
	burning utility,</B> wouldn't harm. Even though a modified
	kernel can let you put for example an ext2 file system on
	DVD+RW, it's probably not very practical, because you most
	likely want to access the data on an <I>arbitrary</I> computer.
	Or in other words you most likely want ISO9660. The trouble is
	that you might as well want to <I>add</I> data now and then.
	And what options do you have in the lack of multiple sessions
	(no, DVD+RW has no notion of multiple sessions)? Complete
	re-mastering which takes more and more time as data set grows?
	Well, yes, <I>unless</I> you employ growisofs! Growisofs

<P><LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>If you have an external unit,</B> just get
it working as CD-ROM first. I myself have no personal experience
whatsoever with <A HREF="http://www.linux-usb.org/">USB</A> or <A
HREF="http://www.linux1394.org/">IEEE1394/Firewire</A> optical storage
devices and have to direct you elsewhere for specific instructions. I
however am confident that if you manage to get your drive working
<I>reliably</I> as <NOBR>CD-ROM</NOBR> <I>and</I> <NOBR>CD-R[W]</NOBR>
burner, then you won't have any troubles with dvd+rw-tools either. USB
connected drives were reported to be working fine since eternity.
Firewire connected drives in turn were reported to fail miserably under
2.4.18. The failure didn't seem to be DVD recording related as it
reportedly failed burning even CD-R media. Firewire support was
substantially revamped in 2.4.19, and dvd+rw-tools were reported to
work with this and later kernels.

<P><LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you're running 2.4.19 or .20, consider
applying <A HREF="sg-2.4.19.patch">this drivers/scsi/sg.c patch</A>.
The bug is fixed in .21. I write &quot;consider&quot; and not
&quot;do&quot; for the following reasons:

<P><UL>
<LI>dvd+rw-tools are not affected by this bug (as they don't use SG_IO
interface), cdrecord [potentially] is;
<LI>I however haven't actually experienced the problem with cdrecord
(maybe yet, kernel could have managed to keep buffers neatly aligned
while talking to cdrecord those times I tried), it was VMware that has
failed miserably on me;
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of version 5.6 dvd+rw-tools add support for SG_IO
pass-through or in other words support for Linux&nbsp;2&gt;=5[.43],
where &quot;generic&quot; SCSI interface can be bypassed by issuing
SG_IO ioctl directly against block device, such as <TT>/dev/hd<FONT
COLOR="red">X</FONT></TT>. I wish it worked without need for <A
HREF="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=105410790500005&r=1&w=2">interim</A>
patches <A HREF="ide-cd-2.5.69.patch">#1</A> and <A
HREF="ide-cd-2.5.69.+patch">#2</A>, (the latter is relative to
2.5.69-75, the 1st problem is addressed in .71, 2nd one - .75-bk3 in
&quot;<A
HREF="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105787192005635&w=2">last
minute</A>&quot; prior first 2.6 cut. As for 2.6 in more general sense.
As you can imagine this new interface renders ide-scsi layer
superfluous and &quot;the[ir] official plan&trade;&quot; is to scrap
it. I'm not really fond of the idea, but not for /dev/sg* account. I
mean I [personally] would prefer to keep ide-scsi and use SG_IO
pass-through with <TT>/dev/scdN</TT>, rather than with
<TT>/dev/hdX</TT>:-)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have to make dvd+rw-tools work under Linux
kernel 2.6.8, then upgrade the tool-chain to 5.21.x or later and
manually reward the installed binaries with set-root-uid flag. But the
&quot;supported&quot; recommendation is to just stay away from this
particular kernel version. <B>As for 2.6&gt;8, dvd+rw-tools 5.21.x is
requirement.</B> Oh! dvd+rw-booktype utility would require set-root-uid
privilege then. Given its semi-official status and the fact that this
utility works only with limited number of units, installation procedure
<I>abstains</I> from installing dvd+rw-booktype set-root-uid, leaving
this security sensitive choice to the end-user.

<P><LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Download, unpack and compile the <A
HREF="tools/?M=D">the tool-chain</A>.</B> To build the thing do pick the
.tar.gz archive, which contains Makefile as well as .spec file. You
will <B>need both C and C++ compilers</B> installed. Separate
source code files found in the <A HREF="tools/?M=D">download catalog</A>
are provided mainly for on-line reference purposes (such as <A
HREF="tools/growisofs.c">revision history</A>:-). 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your Linux kernel supports multiple ABIs (e.g.
Linux-sparc64 can run even 32-bit Linux-sparc applications, as well as
Linux-x86_64 can execute legacy 32-bit i386 binaries), make sure you
compile for <I>native</I> 64-bit ABI (which can normally be done with
'<TT>make TARGET_ARCH=-m64</TT>'). The problem here is that 64-bit
kernel has to explicitly convert ioctl structures passed by 32-bit
applications and apparently it does really lousy job when it comes to
CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctl deployed by dvd+rw-tools.

<P><LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As new media products and brands are being
introduced to the market all the time, it apparently pays off to
<B><I>periodically</I> check for firmware updates.</B> For elder units
firmware update might even be an <B>absolute requirement</B> for using
new media. Special note for HP users. HP no longer posts firmware
updates on a web-page. Instead they let some Windows auto-update gizmo
to pick firmware updates among <NOBR><TT>dvd[1-6]00*.exe</TT></NOBR>
files in <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/information_storage/software/">their FTP
directory</A>, so that readers of this page tend to miss them...

<P><LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Formatting the BD and DVD+RW media.</B>
Virgin BD and DVD+RW media needs to be initally formatted prior usage.
Once again, <B>only virgin BD and DVD+RW media needs to be
formatted.</B> As of version 5.10 growisofs detects blanks and applies
initial formatting procedure automatically. Otherwise same effect can
be achieved by passing the device name, e.g. <TT>/dev/scd0</TT>, as an
argument to <A HREF="tools/dvd+rw-format.cpp">dvd+rw-format</A>. Well,
in <A HREF="Blu-ray">BD case</A> it does offer more flexibility than
growisofs. To make formatting process reasonably fast, less than 1
minute, the media gets formatted only partially, as you can notice by
observing progress indicator displayed by dvd+rw-format. The final
indicator value varies from firmware to firmware, values as low as 1.6%
were observed. But it does not mean that you can only write that
little. The unit keeps formatting <I>transparently</I>, as you add more
data. Oh! Do keep in mind that DVD capacity of 4.7GB is expressed in
salesman's&nbsp;GB, i.e. 1000<SUP>3</SUP> and not 1024<SUP>3</SUP>. And
so is one of BD.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was observed that excessive reformats can render
DVD+RW media unusable already after 10-20 reformats. It appears to be a
firmware deficiency, not some common media defect [at least it was
perfectly possible to salvage the media in a unit of different brand],
but I don't recommend [enforced] reformat in either case.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that <B>re-formatting procedure does not

write over previous recording as it simply wasn't there, no

manual for growisofs. In a nutshell growisofs just passes all command

The first part means that you basically can [well, <I>should</I>]
consult <A HREF="mkisofs.8.html">mkisofs manual page</A> and
accompanying reference documentation (including multisession related

<LI>you may not use -o option;

<LI>there is internal -Z option for initial session recording, this
substitutes for originally suggested 'mkisofs | dd of=/dev/scd0';
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Otherwise <I>everything</I> that applies to
[multisession] mastering with mkisofs applies to growisofs as well. For

you used to master the initial &quot;session&quot; with and stick to
them, e.g.:

comparison between increments as well as fine-graded restore.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Linux 2.6</B> DVD+RW kernel support is planned in
line with DVD+MRW kernel support. This [unfortunately] means that
industry has to deliver a DVD+MRW capable unit first. Yes, the last
sentence means that despite all the promises, there are no such units
available on the market yet. As of the 1st of August 2003, Ricoh MP5240A,
Philips DVDRW416K or BenQ DW400A do <B>not</B> actually implement
Mt.Rainier/EasyWrite support. It remains to be seen if they will offer
it in form of firmware upgrade. In either case, the [original] project
goal is not only read-write support for DVD+[M]RW capable units
themselves, but even playback of DVD+MRW formatted media in legacy
DVD-ROM units (when defect list will be read and interpreted by OS
software in opposite to Mt.Rainier firmware).

<A NAME="udf"><P><LI></A><P ALIGN="justify">Even though kernel now
permits to build and mount arbitrary file system, there is one thing you
<I>must</I> keep in mind before you just proceed, no matter how
tempting it might appear.

<P ALIGN="justify">As you might know DVD+RW media can sustain only
around 1000 overwrites. The thing about fully fledged file systems
is that every read [or tight bunch of 'em] is accompanied by
corresponding i-node update or in other words a write! Now, let's say
you lookup the mount point (e.g. ls /mnt/dvd) ten times a day. This
gives you a 100 days lifetime on your mountpoint and therefore media.
Not really much, huh? So do use <TT>noatime</TT> mount option with
DVD+RW media or have it mounted read-only most of the time. However!
Every read-write mount &quot;costs&quot; a super-block update. So that
if you remount the media say 3 times a day, it would last for about a
year [<A
HREF="http://people.mandrakesoft.com/~quintela/supermount/">supermount</A>
would exhaust the &quot;budget&quot; way sooner]... Defect management
[in firmware, a.k.a. <A

or at file system level] would improve the situation, but ideally
file system driver should definitely refrain from modifying the
super-block [marking it dirty] if nothing was actually written since
last mount. Given the development status of <A

chances for seeing the latter implemented [for UDF] are more than just
conceivable. The request is already filed and even possible solution is
being discussed. But why not give UDF a shot already then? By default
UDF write support is unfortunately disabled and you might have to
reconfigure the kernel and rebuild modules. Alternatively [my preferred
option actually] fetch the code at <A

build the module separately. Of course you will have to fetch and build
udftools as well. But once it's done just type:

so, as common block device layer <I>completely</I> reorganizes the

through block buffer cache. To minimize the pressure and improve
overall system performance bind the cdrom device to a raw device, e.g.
'<TT>raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/scd0</TT>', growisofs will locate and use

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to optimize seek times DVD[-ROM] players
calibrate their mechanics every time the media is loaded by sliding
the optical head some place, picking up the signal and noting the
physical block address underneath the lens. In order for this procedure
to work with re-writable/recordable media, that particular spot has to
be written to [or de-iced in DVD+RW terms]. Some units slide the head to
30mm [radial] to calibrate, some to 35mm. In order to keep such players
&quot;happy,&quot; make sure that at least 1GB is written [before you

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we have logical format compatibility
issue(s). Probably the very ground for all the controversy around
DVD+RW, rather around DVD+RW media not being playable in a whole range

claiming that they deliberately block playback. But the fact is that
format specifications don't explicitly say that unrecognized format
[designated by &quot;Book Type&quot; field in &quot;Control Data

and [in my opinion] it was rather naive of them to claim and expect
that the media will be playable in &quot;virtually all players.&quot;
This deficiency was recognized by practically all DVD+RW vendors [well,

&quot;latest generation&quot; vendors such as Sony, NEC, TDK...] and a
<A HREF="tools/dvd+rw-booktype.cpp">secret</A> vendor-specific command

physical I/O. Now the catch is that block cache layer remains totally
unaware of growisofs activities, growisofs <I>bypasses</I> the block
cache. This means that block cache inevitably becomes out of sync,
which in turn might appear to you as corrupted data. Media reload is
performed when flushing the block cache is not an option, e.g. only
privileged user is allowed to perform it. Second reason is to force
kernel to readjust last addressable block in case it was changed as
result of recording. This is done to preclude spurious "attempts to
access beyond end of device."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>What does [kernel] &quot;DVD+RW support&quot;
<I>really</I> mean?</B> Even though DVD+RW has no notion of [multiple]
sessions, to ensure compatibility with DVD-ROM it's essential to issue
&quot;CLOSE TRACK/SESSION (5Bh)&quot; <A
HREF="http://www.t10.org/scsi-3.htm">MMC</A> command to
terminate/suspend background formatting (if any in progress) whenever
you intend to eject the media or simply stop writing and want better
read performance (e.g. remount file system read-only). This is what the
patch is basically about: noting when/if media was written to and
"finalizing" at unlock door.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Secondly</B>, whenever you employ fully fledged
file system, I/O requests get inevitably fragmented.
&quot;Fragmented&quot; means following. Even though you can address the
data with 2KB granularity, it [data] is physically laid out in 32KB
chunks. This in turn means that for example writing of 2KB block
involves reading of 32KB chunk, replacing corresponding 2KB and writing
down of modified 32KB chunk. &quot;Fragmented requests&quot; are those
that are smaller than 32KB or/and cross the modulus 32KB boundaries. In
order to optimize the process certain caching algorithm is implemented
in unit's firmware. Obviously it can't adequately meet all possible
situations. And so in such unfortunate situations the drive apparently
stops processing I/O requests returning &quot;COMMAND SEQUENCE ERROR
(2Ch)&quot; ASC. This is the second essential of &quot;DVD+RW
support,&quot; namely injecting of &quot;SYNCHRONIZE CACHE (35h)&quot;
MMC command in reply to the error condition in question. The command
flushes the cached buffers which makes it possible to resume the data
flow.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Unfortunately</B> the above paragraph doesn't
seem to apply to the 1st generation drives, Ricoh MP5120A and
derivatives<TT>:-(</TT> &quot;SYNCHRONIZE CACHE (35h)&quot; doesn't
seem to be sufficient and the unit keeps replying with &quot;COMMAND
SEQUENCE ERROR (2Ch)&quot; going into end-less loop. This makes it
impossible to deploy arbitrary file system. I'm open for
suggestions... Meanwhile the I've chosen to simply suspend I/O till the
media is unmounted. Even 2nd gen unit were reported to exhibit similar
[but not the same] behaviour under apparently extremely rare
circumstances. At least I failed to reproduce the problem... The problem
reportedly disappears with firmware upgrade...

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Then</B> some [most?] of post-2nd gen units, from
most vendors, seem to not bother about complying with
<NOBR>DVD+RW</NOBR> specification, &quot;true random write with 2KB
granularity&quot; part in particular. Instead they apparently expect
host to apply procedure pretty much equivalent to <NOBR>DVD-RW</NOBR>
Restricted Overwrite. To be more specific host seems to be expected to
coalesce 2KB requests and perform aligned writes at native DVD ECC
blocksize, which is 32KB. Formally this should not be required, but
it's the reality of marketplace:-(

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This one really beats me. Sometimes the unit
simply stops writing signaling a vendor specific positioning error,
03h/15h/82h to be specific. Especially if the media is newly formatted.
Couple of work theories. One is that block buffer cache reorders
requests so that they are not sequential anymore, &quot;FLUSH
CACHE&quot; might do the trick. Another one is that under
&quot;underrun&quot; condition background formatting kicks off and has
to be explicitly stopped. &quot;Underrun&quot; is in quotes because
the unit is supposed to handle temporary data stream outages
gracefully. If you run into this (you most likely will), try to
complement growisofs command line with [undocumented]
<TT>-poor-man</TT> option (which has to be first in the command line).
This option eliminates request reorders and minimizes possibility for
&quot;underrun&quot; condition (by releasing the pressure off VM
subsystem).

<P><BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The original idea was to implement DVD+RW support in
drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c. Unfortunately SCSI layer maintains private
&quot;writeable&quot; flag controlling the ability to issue WRITE
commands. The flag is impossible to reach for from the Unified CD-ROM
driver. But why am I talking about SCSI when there are only IDE units
out there (at least for the time being)? Well, as you most likely want
to occasionally burn even CD-R[W] with cdrecord you want it to go
through ide-scsi emulation layer anyway. So I figured that SCSI CD-ROM
driver is the one to aim for even for DVD+RW.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately it was not possible to implement it
completely in sr_mod.o<TT>:-(</TT> Minor drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c
modification was required to sense the media before decision about
whether or not to permit write open. That's because DVD+RW drives are
morphing their behaviour after currently mounted media and it's
essential to identify newly inserted media.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special comment about &quot;what a dirty
hack!!!&quot; To my great surprise it turned out that time-out value you
pass in cdrom_generic_command is simply ignored and time-out is set to
pre-compiled value of 30 seconds. Unfortunately it's way too low for
formatting purposes and I had to do something about it. Alternative to
&quot;the dirty hack&quot; was to add another argument to sr_do_ioctl
and modify all the calls to it... I've chosen to take over those 31
unused bits from the &quot;quiet&quot; argument instead of modifying
all the calls (too boring).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But even if time-out value passed down to kernel
(with <I>either</I> CDROM_SEND_PACKET or SG_IO ioctl) is taken into
consideration, it's apparently not interpreted as user-land code
expects it to. As I figured... There is no documentation on
CDROM_SEND_PACKET, but following the common sense most programmers
(including myself:-) expect it to be interpreted in at least
platform-independent manner, such as milliseconds maybe? SG_IO timeout
in turn is <A
HREF="http://www.torque.net/sg/p/sg_v3_ho.html#AEN215"><I>documented</I></A>
to be measured in milliseconds... Neither of this holds true! Kernel
treats these values as &quot;jiffies,&quot; which is a
<B>platform-dependent</B> value representing time elapsed between timer
interrupts. But if we attempt to send down &quot;jiffies,&quot; it
might turn out wrong too [at least for the moment of this writing]. The
catch is that [IA-32] kernel developers figured it's cool to shorten
&quot;jiffy,&quot; but didn't care to provide user-land with actual
value (well, not of actual interest, too much legacy code to deal with)
<I>nor</I> <A HREF="scsi_ioctl-2.5.69.patch">scale</A> timeouts
accordingly in respect to the legacy value of 10ms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another kernel &quot;deficiency&quot; I ran
into while working on the (original version of) dvd+rw-format utility.
The drive provides background formatting progress status, but
unfortunately it's impossible to access it. That's because progress
counter is returned [in reply to &quot;TEST UNIT READY&quot;] as
&quot;NO SENSE/LOGICAL UNIT NOT READY/FORMAT IN PROGRESS&quot; sense
bytes but with &quot;GOOD&quot; status. Apparently any sense data with
&quot;GOOD&quot; status is discarded by the common SCSI layer.

<!--
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you might have noticed the time-out value for
&quot;CLOSE SESSION&quot; is 3000 seconds. Does it really take that
long? It might... Disappointed? Don't be! It might happen <I>only</I>
when <I>reformatting</I> used media. Formatting of the <I>blank</I>
media doesn't take longer than a couple of minutes. <I>Reformatting</I>
in turn takes as long as it takes to nullify whatever you had on the
media which requires corresponding time-outs. But do you <I>have to</I>
reformat? Well, only if media contains sensitive data, the new data set
is smaller than the current one and (for some reason) will be easier
for potentially rival party to get hold of it (in other words when
there is a risk for sensitive data to get exposed). Another reason is
when you want to reuse the media as a master copy for DVD-ROM
manufacturing and want formatted capacity to reflect data set size.
Otherwise there is <I>no</I> reason to reformat and as long as you
don't you won't be disappointed with how long does it take to
&quot;finalize&quot; the media.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>What does <A
HREF="http://www.cdfreaks.com/article/113"><I>plus</I></A> in DVD+RW/+R
stand for?</B> Originally this paragraph started as following:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key feature of DVD+RW/+R media is
high [spatial] frequency wobbled [pre-]groove with addressing
information modulated into it. This makes it possible to resume
interrupted [or deliberately suspended] burning process with accuracy
high enough for DVD[-ROM] player not to &quot;notice&quot; anything at
playback time. Recovery from buffer underrun condition in DVD-RW/-R
case in turn is way less accurate procedure, and the problem is that
the provided accuracy is very much what average player can tolerate.
Now given that both provided and tolerated inaccuracies are
proportional to respectively writing and reading velocities there
basically no guarantee that DVD-RW/-R recording that suffered from
buffer underrun will be <I>universally</I> playable.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, it turned out that I was wrong about one
thing. <!--About projecting CD-R[W] buffer underrun recovery procedure
to DVD-R[W] to be specific.--> I failed to recognize that DVD-R[W]
groove also provides for <I>adequately</I> accurate recovery from
buffer underrun condition/lossless linking. Not as accurate as DVD+RW,
but accurate enough for splices to be playable in virtually any
DVD-ROM/-Video unit. Yet! When it comes to DVD-R[W] recording
specificaton apparently insists that you choose between

<UL>
<LI>buffer underrun protection and
<LI>full DVD-ROM/-Video compatibility.
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The specification asserts that the latter is
achieved only in Disc-at-once recording mode and only if data-stream
was maintained uninterrupted throughout whole recording. Once again.
Even though most vendors implement lossless linking in DAO
mode<SUP>(*)</SUP>, <I>full</I> DVD-ROM/-Video compatibility is
guaranteed only if recording didn't suffer from buffer underruns. The
problem is that &quot;offended&quot; sectors are denoted with certain
linking chunk appearing as degraded <I>user data</I>, few bytes, which
are supposed to be &quot;corrected away&quot; by ECC
procedure<SUP>(**)</SUP>. DVD+ splices are in turn only few bits large
and are &quot;accounted&quot; to sync patterns, <I>not to user data
area</I>. So that even if suffered from buffer underrun, DVD+ sector is
logically indistiguishable from DVD-ROM. Which is why it's commonly
referred to that DVD+RW/+R combine DVD-ROM/-Video compatibility with
[unconditional] buffer underrun protection.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As already mentioned, DVD+ groove has
&quot;addressing information modulated into it,&quot; ADIP (ADress In
Pre-groove). This gives you an advantage of writing DVD+RW in truly
arbitrary order, even to virgin surface and practically instantly
(after ~40 seconds long initial format procedure). In addition, DVD+RW
can be conveniently written to with 2KB granularity<SUP>(***)</SUP>.
DVD-RW in turn can only be <I>overwritten</I> in arbitrary order.
Meaning that it either has to be completely formatted first (it takes
an hour to format 1x media), or initially written to in a sequential
manner. And it should also be noted that block overwrite is
<I>never</I> an option if DVD-RW media was recorded in [compatible]
Disc-at-once or even Incremental mode, only whole disc blanking is.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike DVD-R[W], DVD+R[W] recordings can be
suspended at any time without any side effects. Consider following
scenario. You have a lot of data coming in [at lower rate], which is to
be recorded into one file. Meanwhile it turns out that you have to
retrieve previously recorded data. This would naturally require
suspention of recording. Most notably in DVD-R [and naturally DVD-RW
Sequential] case it would result in a hole in the file being recorded.
So called linking area, most commonly 32KB gap, has to be introduced.
So that you either have to wait till the file is complete or figure out
how to deal with holey files. Thanks to ADIP, DVD+R recording is
resumed from the very point it was suspended at. In DVD-RW Restricted
Overwrite case no gaps are introduced, but if the media was formatted
only minimally, suspension/resuming procedure has to be applied and it
takes ~40 seconds to perform one. In DVD+RW case, suspension/resuming
is instant regardless media state.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does all of the above mean in practice? Well, I
was actually hoping that readers would [be able to] figure it out by
themselves. Apparently a couple of &quot;guiding&quot; words are
needed... It means that it's trivial to employ DVD+RW for housing of
live and arbitrary file system, no special modifications to target file
system driver are required... Real-time VBR (Variable Bit Rate) Video
recordings are children's game...

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes DVD+RW/+R recording strategy is referred
to as packet writing. I myself am reluctant to call it so (or
TAO/SAO/DAO) for the following reason. Despite the fact that DVD-R[W]
provides for lossless linking (within a packet/extent only),
packets/extents are still denoted with certain linking information
which distinguishes it (recording mode in question) from e.g.
Disc-at-once. Now the point is that written DVD+RW/+R media, rather its
Data Zone, does not contain <I>any</I> linking information and is
logically indistinguishable from one written in DVD-R[W] Disc-at-once
mode (or DVD-ROM for that matter).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's maintained that signal from DVD+ groove (the
one essential for recording, not reading) is much stronger, which makes
it quite resistant to dust, scratches, etc. 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now we can also discuss differences between
Double/Dual Layer implementations. DVD+R Double Layer permits for
arbitrary layer break positioning yet maintaining <I>contiguous logical
block addressing</I>. In other words address of the block following the
break is always address of the block preceding one plus 1, even for
arbitrarily positioned break. <NOBR>DVD-R</NOBR> Dual Layer on the
other hand implies unconditionally disjoint logical block addressing
[for arbitrarily positioned layer break that is]. This is because block
addresses as recorded by unit are pre-defined by <NOBR>DVD-dash</NOBR>
groove structure. In practice it means that file system layout has to
effectively have a hole, which "covers" twice the space between chosen
layer break position and outermost edge of the recordable area. And in
even more practical terms this means that mastering programs have to be
explicitly adapted for <NOBR>DVD-R</NOBR> layer break positioning.
Unlike DVD+plus that is.

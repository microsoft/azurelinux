ripgrep is a line oriented search tool that combines the usability of
The Silver Searcher (similar to ack) with the raw speed of GNU grep.
ripgrep works by recursively searching your current directory
for a regex pattern.

- Update to version 11.0.2
  * See included CHANGELOG.md for the complete changelog
* Sun Sep 16 2018 Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>
- Updated to version 0.10.0
- Breaking change
  * The match semantics of -w/--word-regexp have changed slightly.
    They used to be \b(?:<your pattern>)\b. Now, it's
    (?:^|\W)(?:<your pattern>)(?:$|\W). This matches the behavior
    of GNU grep and is believed to be closer to the intended
    semantics of the flag.
- Features
  * Add -U/--multiline flag that permits matching over multiple lines.
  * Add -P/--pcre2 flag that gives support for look-around and
    backreferences.
  * Add --json flag that prints results in a JSON Lines format.
  * --one-file-system flag to skip directories on different file systems.
  * Add --sort and --sortr flag for more sorting. Deprecate --sort-files.
  * The --trim flag strips prefix whitespace from all lines printed.
  * Add --null-data flag, which makes ripgrep use NUL as a line terminator.
  * The --passthru flag now works with the --replace flag.
  * Add --line-buffered and --block-buffered for forcing a buffer strategy.
  * Add --pre-glob for filtering files through the --pre flag.
- Bug fixes
  * Searching with non-zero context can now use memory maps if
    appropriate.
  * ripgrep will now stop correctly when its output pipe is closed.
  * The -w/--word-regexp flag now works more intuitively.
  * Detection of readable stdin has improved on Windows.
  * Matching empty lines now works correctly in several corner cases.
  * Color escape sequences now coalesce, which reduces output size.
  * ripgrep is now more robust with respect to memory maps failing.
  * Color escape sequences are no longer emitted for empty matches.
  * Context from the --passthru flag should not impact process exit status.
  * Fixes bug in ignore crate where first path was always treated
    as a symlink.
  * Read stderr asynchronously when running a process.
  * Add compile time and runtime CPU features to --version output.
  * Don't complete bare pattern after -f in zsh.
* Mon Aug 27 2018 jengelh@inai.de
- Update RPM groups and summary.
* Sun Aug 26 2018 viktor.saevars@gmail.com
- Updated to version 0.9.0
- Breaking changes
  * When --count and --only-matching are provided simultaneously,
    the behavior of ripgrep is as if the --count-matches flag was given.
  * Octal syntax is no longer supported.
  * The --line-number-width flag has been removed.
- Features
  * Added a --stats flag, which emits aggregate statistics
    after search results.

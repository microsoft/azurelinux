  when lmtp_rcpt_check_quota=yes
- LDA Sieve plugin: Fixed sequential execution of LDAP-based scripts. A
  missing LDAP-based script could cause the script sequence to exit earlier.
- sieve-filter: Removed the (now) duplicate utf8 to mutf7 mailbox name

- dovecot updated to 2.2.31
- Various fixes to handling mailbox listing. Especially related to
  handling nonexistent autocreated/autosubscribed mailboxes and ACLs.

- Message address parsing could have crashed on invalid input.
- imapc_features=fetch-headers wasn't always working correctly and
  caused the full header to be fetched.

- dovecot updated to 2.2.29.1
- dict-sql: Merging multiple UPDATEs to a single statement wasn't
  actually working.
- pigeonhole updated to 0.4.18
- imapsieve plugin: Implemented the copy_source_after rule action. When this
  is enabled for a mailbox rule, the specified Sieve script is executed for
  the message in the source mailbox during a "COPY" event. This happens only
  after the Sieve script that is executed for the corresponding message in the
  destination mailbox finishes running successfully.
- imapsieve plugin: Added non-standard Sieve environment items for the source
  and destination mailbox.
- multiscript: The execution of the discard script had an implicit "keep",

  Content-Disposition header. Broken by 2.2.28.
- trash plugin was broken in 2.2.28

- Fixed crash in auth process when auth-policy was configured and
  authentication was aborted/failed without a username set.
- director: If two users had different tags but the same hash,
  the users may have been redirected to the wrong tag's hosts.

  "Missing middle file seq=.." to be logged and index rebuild.
  This happened more easily with IMAP hibernation enabled.
- Various fixes to restoring state correctly in un-hibernation.
- dovecot.index files were commonly 4 bytes per email too large. This
  is because 3 bytes per email were being wasted that could have been
  used for IMAP keywords.

- Fixed assert-crash in HTML to text parsing with specific input
  (e.g. for FTS indexing or snippet generation)

  inside lib-index, which runs index fsck.

  quota roots.
- search: Multiple sequence sets or UID sets in search parameters
  weren't handled correctly. They were incorrectly merged together.

- dovecot updated to 2.2.26.0, pigeonhole updated to 0.4.16
- master process's listener socket was leaked to all child processes.
  This might have allowed untrusted processes to capture and prevent
  "doveadm service stop" comands from working.
- login proxy: Fixed crash when outgoing SSL connections were hanging.
- auth: userdb fields weren't passed to auth-workers, so %%{userdb:*}
  from previous userdbs didn't work there.

- dict-redis: Fixed timeout handling
- SEARCH INTHREAD was crashing
- stats: Only a single fifo_listeners was supported, making it impossible to
  use both auth_stats=yes and mail stats plugin.
- SSL errors were logged in separate "Stacked error" log lines instead of as
  part of the disconnection reason.
- MIME body parser didn't handle properly when a child MIME part's --boundary
  had the same prefix as the parent.
- pigeonhole updated to 0.4.14

- dovecot updated to 2.2.22

  used in default_fields, override_fields or LDAP pass/user_attrs.
  userdb result_* were also ignored when user was found from cache.
- imap: Fixed various assert-crashes caused v2.2.20+. Some of them
  caught actual hangs or otherwise unwanted behavior towards IMAP

  in v2.2.20+

  always merged correctly and implicit side effects were not always
  handled correctly.
- Fixed a segfault bug in the sieve-test tool occuring when compile
  fails.

  merging side effects in duplicate actions.

  This prevents users from exploiting (most of the) potential security
  holes in zlib/bzlib.

  v0.99.14 2005-02-11  Timo Sirainen <tss at iki.fi>
  - Message address fields are now parsed differently, fixing some
    issues with spaces. Affects only clients which use FETCH ENVELOPE
    command.
  - Message MIME parser was somewhat broken with missing MIME boundaries
  - mbox: Don't allow X-UID headers in mails to override the UIDs we
    would otherwise set. Too large values can break some clients and
    cause other trouble.
  - passwd-file userdb wasn't working
  - PAM crashed with 64bit systems
  - non-SSL inetd startup wasn't working
  - If UID FETCH notices and skips an expunged message, don't return
    a NO reply. It's not needed and only makes clients give error
    messages.

* Wed Sep  8 2004 John Dennis <jdennis@redhat.com> 0.99.11-1.FC3.1
- bring up to latest upstream,
  comments from Timo Sirainen <tss at iki.fi> on release v0.99.11 2004-09-04  
  + 127.* and ::1 IP addresses are treated as secured with
    disable_plaintext_auth = yes
  + auth_debug setting for extra authentication debugging
  + Some documentation and error message updates
  + Create PID file in /var/run/dovecot/master.pid
  + home setting is now optional in static userdb
  + Added mail setting to static userdb
  - After APPENDing to selected mailbox Dovecot didn't always notice the
    new mail immediately which broke some clients
  - THREAD and SORT commands crashed with some mails
  - If APPENDed mail ended with CR character, Dovecot aborted the saving
  - Output streams sometimes sent data duplicated and lost part of it.
    This could have caused various strange problems, but looks like in
    practise it rarely caused real problems.

* Wed Aug  4 2004 John Dennis <jdennis@redhat.com>

- IMAP BODY and BODYSTRUCTURE replies were wrong for MIME parts which
  didn't contain Content-Type header.
- MySQL and PostgreSQL auth didn't reconnect if connection was lost
  to SQL server
- Linking fixes for dovecot-auth with some systems
- Last fix for disconnecting client when downloading mail longer than
  30 seconds actually made it never disconnect client. Now it works
  properly: disconnect when client hasn't read _any_ data for 30
  seconds.
- MySQL compiling got broken in last release
- More PostgreSQL reconnection fixing

* Mon Jul 26 2004 John Dennis <jdennis@redhat.com> 0.99.10.7-1,FC3,1
- enable postgres and mySQL in build
- fix configure to look for mysql in alternate locations
- nuke configure script in tar file, recreate from configure.in using autoconf
- bring up to latest upstream, which included:
- Added outlook-pop3-no-nuls workaround to fix Outlook hang in mails with NULs.
- Config file lines can now contain quoted strings ("value ")
- If client didn't finish downloading a single mail in 30 seconds,
  Dovecot closed the connection. This was supposed to work so that
  if client hasn't read data at all in 30 seconds, it's disconnected.
- Maildir: LIST now doesn't skip symlinks

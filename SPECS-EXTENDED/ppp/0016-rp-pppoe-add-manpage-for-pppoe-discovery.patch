+.TH PPPOE-DISCOVERY 8
+.SH NAME
+pppoe\-discovery \- perform PPPoE discovery
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B pppoe\-discovery
+[
+.I options
+]
+.br
+.BR pppoe\-discovery " { " \-V " | " \-h " }"
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.LP
+\fBpppoe\-discovery\fR performs the same discovery process as
+\fBpppoe\fR, but does not initiate a session.
+It sends a PADI packet and then prints the names of access
+concentrators in each PADO packet it receives.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.BI \-I " interface"
+.RS
+The \fB\-I\fR option specifies the Ethernet interface to use.
+Under Linux, it is typically eth0 or eth1.
+The interface should be \(lqup\(rq before you start
+\fBpppoe\-discovery\fR, but should \fInot\fR be configured to have an
+IP address.
+The default interface is eth0.
+.RE
+.TP
+.BI \-D " file_name"
+.RS
+The \fB\-D\fR option causes every packet to be dumped to the specified
+\fIfile_name\fR.
+This is intended for debugging only.
+.RE
+.TP
+.B \-U
+.RS
+Causes \fBpppoe\-discovery\fR to use the Host-Uniq tag in its discovery
+packets.
+This lets you run multiple instances of \fBpppoe\-discovery\fR and/or
+\fBpppoe\fR without having their discovery packets interfere with one
+another.
+You must supply this option to \fIall\fR instances that you intend to
+run simultaneously.
+.RE
+.TP
+.BI \-S " service_name"
+.RS
+Specifies the desired service name.
+\fBpppoe\-discovery\fR will only accept access concentrators which can
+provide the specified service.
+In most cases, you should \fInot\fR specify this option.
+Use it only if you know that there are multiple access concentrators
+or know that you need a specific service name.
+.RE
+.TP
+.BI \-C " ac_name"
+.RS
+Specifies the desired access concentrator name.
+\fBpppoe\-discovery\fR will only accept the specified access
+concentrator.
+In most cases, you should \fInot\fR specify this option.
+Use it only if you know that there are multiple access concentrators.
+If both the \fB\-S\fR and \fB\-C\fR options are specified, they must
+\fIboth\fR match.
+.RE
+.TP
+.B \-A
+.RS
+This option is accepted for compatibility with \fBpppoe\fR, but has no
+effect.
+.RE
+.TP
+.BR \-V " | " \-h
+.RS
+Either of these options causes \fBpppoe\-discovery\fR to print its
+version number and usage information, then exit.
+.RE

+\fBpppoe\-discovery\fR was written by Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it>,
+based on \fBpppoe\fR by David F. Skoll <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>.

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Do not restart service after unclean exit code

Currently, the vino-server.service has Restart=on-failure, which means
that it is restarted in abnormal cases, but also in case of non-zero
exit code. It is restarted 5 times e.g. in case when X11 is not detected,
which doesn't make sense. Non-zero exit code is used only for states
which won't change with restart (invalid commandline, wayland and some
sanity checks). Change the value to Restart=on-abnormal in order to
prevent the useless restarts and to not spam journal.

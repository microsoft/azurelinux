%description
This class encapsulates/makes/manipulates objects that represent nodes in a
tree structure. The tree structure is not an object itself, but is emergent
from the linkages you create between nodes. This class provides the methods
for making linkages that can be used to build up a tree, while preventing you
from ever making any kinds of linkages that are not allowed in a tree (such as
having a node be its own mother or ancestor, or having a node have two
mothers).

- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_24_Mass_Rebuild

- Update to 1.27
  - Remove the line that reads 'use open qw(:std :utf8);' (CPAN RT#105798)
  - Remove Build.PL, ship only Makefile.PL
  - Remove .gitignore from MANIFEST

* Mon Jun 22 2015 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.26-4
- Specify all dependencies (#1234366)

* Thu Jun 18 2015 Fedora Release Engineering <rel-eng@lists.fedoraproject.org> - 1.26-3
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_23_Mass_Rebuild

* Sat Jun 06 2015 Jitka Plesnikova <jplesnik@redhat.com> - 1.26-2
- Perl 5.22 rebuild

* Sun Apr 12 2015 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.26-1
- Update to 1.26
  - Fix bug in string2hashref(), which failed on some strings, such as
    {a => 'b, c'}
  - Add t/string2hash.t to test new code

* Mon Mar 23 2015 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.25-1
- Update to 1.25
  - Deleted the undocumented sub _dump_quote(), which butchered Unicode
    characters when it tried to convert ASCII control characters into printable
    strings (on the assumption all data is ASCII); methods that used to call
    _dump_quote() now just output the node's name by calling quote_name(),
    which is discussed next, and undefined names are output as the string
    'undef'
  - Add method quote_name(), which simply returns its input string surrounded
    by single-quotes
  - Add method decode_lol(), which converts the output of tree_to_lol() and
    tree_to_simple_lol() into something that is easy to read
  - Re-order a couple of methods called tree_*(), so that they are in
    alphabetical order
  - Expand the docs for methods tree_to_*(), regarding undefined node names
  - Add scripts/write.tree.pl, which creates the test input file
    t/tree.utf8.attributes.txt (note: this file is now much more complex than
    in previous versions)
  - Add scripts/read.tree.pl, and its output file scripts/read.tree.log; this
    program demonstrates the output produced by various methods
  - Fix the faulty syntax I had used in Build.PL to identify the github repo
  - Delete and re-create github repo after 'git push' failed to upload the new
    version
  - Add LICENSE file to MANIFEST
- Package LICENSE and scripts (as documentation)

* Sun Jan 25 2015 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.24-1
- Update to 1.24
  - Clean up discussion in docs of original author's reluctance to allow
    parameters to new()
  - Rewrite bareword filehandles to use a variable (my $fh)
  - Rename github repo from Tree--DAG_Node to Tree-DAG_Node - my new standard;
    update Build.PL and Makefile.PL to match
  - Reformat the docs to be â‰¤ 100 chars per line - my new standard
  - Change horizontal indentation used by node2string() to add 1 space, so '|'
    lines up underneath the first char of the previous node's name

* Tue Oct 21 2014 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.23-1
- Update to 1.23
  - Change output format when using node2string(), which is called by
    tree2string(); indentation that used to be '|---' is now '|--- ', which
    makes the difference between node names ''/'-', '1'/'-1', etc. much clearer
- Classify buildreqs by usage

* Thu Aug 28 2014 Jitka Plesnikova <jplesnik@redhat.com> - 1.22-3
- Perl 5.20 rebuild

* Sat Jun 07 2014 Fedora Release Engineering <rel-eng@lists.fedoraproject.org> - 1.22-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_21_Mass_Rebuild

* Wed Feb 26 2014 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.22-1
- Update to 1.22
  - Switch from File::Slurp to File::Slurp::Tiny (CPAN RT#92976)

* Fri Jan 31 2014 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.20-1
- Update to 1.20
  - Bump File::Temp version requirement back up to 0.19, as that's the version
    that introduced the newdir() method, as used in the test suite

* Thu Jan 30 2014 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.19-1
- Update to 1.19
  - Set pre-req File::Temp version # to 0 (back from 0.2301)

* Thu Sep 19 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.18-1
- Update to 1.18
  - No changes, code or otherwise, except for the version # in the *.pm, this
    file, and Changelog.ini
  - Somehow a corrupted version got uploaded to search.cpan.org, so I've just
    changed the version # (the file on MetaCPAN was fine)

* Mon Sep 16 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.17-1
- Update to 1.17
  - Write test temp files in :raw mode as well as utf-8, for MS Windows users
  - Take the opportunity to change all utf8 to utf-8, as per the docs for Encode,
    except for 'use warnings qw(FATAL utf8);', which doesn't accept utf-8 :-(

* Mon Sep  9 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.16-1
- Update to 1.16
  - Merge patch (slightly modified by me) from Tom Molesworth (CPAN RT#88501):
    - Remove 'use open qw(:std :utf8);' because of its global effect
    - Replace Perl6::Slurp with File::Slurp, using the latter's binmode option
      for the encoding
    - Fix docs where I'd erroneously said File::Slurp didn't support utf8

* Fri Sep  6 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.15-1
- Update to 1.15
  - Replace Path::Tiny with File::Spec, because the former's list of
    dependencies is soooo long :-( (CPAN RT#88435)
  - Move t/pod.t to xt/author/pod.t
- Explicitly run the author tests

* Thu Sep  5 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.14-1
- Update to 1.14
  - Document the copy() method
  - Patch the copy() method so it respects the {no_attribute_copy => 1} option
  - Add method read_tree(), for text files; it uses Perl6::Slurp, which
    supports utf8
  - Add methods read_attributes() and string2hashref($s) for use by read_tree()
  - Add t/read.tree.t to test read_tree()
  - Add t/tree.utf8.attributes.txt, in utf8, for use by t/read.tree.t
  - Add t/tree.with.attributes.txt and t/tree.without.attributes.txt for use by
    t/read.tree.t
  - Make Perl 5.8.1 a pre-req so we have access to the utf8 pragma

* Mon Aug 12 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.13-1
- Update to 1.13
  - Change the values accepted for the no_attributes option from undef and 1
    to 0 and 1; if undef is used, it becomes 0, so pre-existing code will not
    change behavior, whilst this makes it easier to pass 0 or 1 from the
    command line

- Update to 1.07

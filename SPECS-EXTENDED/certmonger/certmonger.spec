* Sun Feb 19 2017 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.79-1
- update to 0.79:
  - getcert now offers an option (-X) for requesting processing by a particular
    CA if the server we're contacting is running more than one
  - getcert also offers options (--for-ca, --not-for-ca, --ca-path-length) for
    requesting BasicConstraints values
  - getcert now displays times in local time instead of UTC, which was
    previously the only way they were displayed; the --utc option can often be
    used to switch back to its previous behavior
  - the SCEP enrollment helper now correctly issues GetCACertChain requests to
    SCEP servers, instead of issuing a GetCAChain request, which isn't part of
    the protocol; from report by Jason Garland
  - when issuing SCEP requests, the ID of the CA included in the HTTP request
    is now URL-encoded, as it should be
  - renewal or notification-of-impending-expiration logic is now triggered
    closer to TTL thresholds rather than waiting for a periodic check to pass a
    threshold
  - properly builds with OpenSSL 1.1, thanks to Lukas Slebodnik and Tomas Mraz
    for a lot of the legwork
- resync .spec file with Fedora
- upstream project migrated from fedorahosted.org to pagure.io

* Fri Feb 10 2017 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 0.78.6-6
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_26_Mass_Rebuild

* Sat Jan 21 2017 Igor Gnatenko <ignatenko@redhat.com> - 0.78.6-5
- Rebuild for xmlrpc-c

* Wed Jul  6 2016 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.78.6-4
- add backported fix to wait a reasonable amount of time after calling the
  'resubmit' method for a new certificate to be issued when we're exercising
  the D-Bus API during tests (Jan Cholasta, #1351052)

* Wed Jul  6 2016 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.78.6-3
- instead of using killall to send a SIGHUP to the system bus daemon in %%post
  to get it to reload its configuration, use dbus-send to send a ReloadConfig
  request over the bus (should fix #1277573)

* Wed Feb 03 2016 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 0.78.6-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_24_Mass_Rebuild

* Wed Jan 13 2016 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.78.6-1
- document the -R, -N, -o, and -t flags for dogtag-ipa-renew-agent-submit
- stop checking that we can generate 512 bit keys during self-tests

* Thu Nov 12 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.78.5-1
- fix a possible uninitialized memory read (possibly #1260871)
- log a diagnostic error when we fail to initialize libkrb5

* Tue Aug  4 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.78.4-1

- output diagnostics about the second request when scep-submit encounters an
  error during a second request to the SCEP server

* Mon Jul 20 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.78.3-1
- call poptGetOptArg() correctly, to fix parsing of the -R flag to scep-submit
  and the -O and -o flags to dogtag-submit (#1244914)

* Thu Jul  9 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.78.2-1
- tweak initialization so that we set up for providing our D-Bus API before we
  register our name with the bus, so that we can handle any requests that
  arrive before the acknowledgement of that registration
- on systems that run systemd, add the right data file so that the service gets
  started when someone tries to talk to the daemon (ticket #38)
- correctly check for error responses when sending GetCAChain requests to SCEP
  servers

* Sun Jun 21 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.78.1-1
- self-tests: assume that certutil won't generate DSA keys with more than 1024
  bits, and will often short us by a few

* Sat Jun 20 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.78-1
- switch to using popt for parsing command line arguments, continuing to
  use old help text for now so that we can catch up with translations (print
  old text for --help, new text (with longopts!) for -H)
- add some plumbing for eventually receiving per-certificate roots in
  addition to issued certificates and chain certificates
- add a "rekey" command to getcert, for triggering enrollment using a new
  key pair (#1087932)
- scep-submit: check for the Renewal capability, and default to taking
  advantage of it during rekeying, unless the new -n flag is specified to it
- dogtag-submit: add flags for passing user names, UDNs, passwords, and PINs
  to the helper (part of ticket #12)
- dogtag-submit: add a flag for using the agent creds to do TLS client auth
  while submitting enrollment requests (more of ticket #12)
- dogtag-submit: handle cases where we submit a request and the server
  returns a success code rather than just queuing the request (#12 again)
- ipa-submit: pass requested profile names to the server as an argument
  named "profile_id"; if the server gives us an "unrecognized argument"
  error, retry without it for compatibility's sake (part of IPA ticket #57)
- keygen: fix a possible crash if keygen fails to return a key from NSS
- correct the certmonger(8) man page's description of the -c flag, which it
  used to call the -C flag
- add logic for setting ownership and permissions on certificates and keys
  when saving them to disk
- add configuration options "max_key_lifetime" and "max_key_use_count" for
  making automatic renewal prefer rekeying

* Wed Jun 17 2015 Fedora Release Engineering <rel-eng@lists.fedoraproject.org> - 0.77.5-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_23_Mass_Rebuild

* Thu May 28 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.77.5-1
- pass $CERTMONGER_REQ_IP_ADDRESS to enrollment helpers if the signing request
  includes IP address subjectAltName values
- correctly verify signatures on SCEP server replies when the signer is neither
  the top-level CA nor the RA (feedback in #1161768)
- correctly verify signatures on SCEP server replies when there is more than
  one certificate in the chain between the RA and the top-level CA (feedback in
  #1161768)

* Fri May 15 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.77.4-1
- don't display PINs in "getcert list" output (#42)
- clean up launching of a private instance in "getcert"
- expand on the don't-delete-private-key fix from 0.77.3 by letting NSS's
  own safety checks have an effect
- backport record-keeping of key generation dates and counts of how many
  times we've gotten certificates using a given key pair

* Thu May  7 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.77.3-1
- fix a data loss bug when saving renewed certificates to NSS databases - the
  private key could be removed in error since 0.77
- fixes for bugs found by static analysis
- fix self-tests when built with OpenSSL 1.0.2

* Tue Apr 14 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.77.2-1
- expose the certificate's not-valid-before and not-valid-after dates as a
  property over D-Bus (ticket #41)
- give the local signer its own configuration option to set the lifetime
  of its signing certificate, falling back to the lifetime configured for
  the self-signer as a default to match the previous behavior
- fix a potential read segfault parsing the output of an enrollment helper,
  introduced in 0.77 (thanks to Steve Neuharth)
- read the ns-certtype extension value in certificates
- request an enrollment certtype extension to CSRs if we have a profile name
  that we want to use (ticket #17, possibly part of IPA ticket #57)

* Fri Feb 27 2015 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.77.1-1
- update to 0.77
  - add initial, still rough, SCEP support (#1140241,#1161768)
    - add an scep-submit helper to handle part of it
  - getcert: add add-ca/add-scep-ca/modify-ca/remove-ca commands
  - getcert: add -l, -L flags to request/resubmit/start-tracking commands
    to provide a way to set a ChallengePassword in signing requests
  - lay some groundwork for rekeying support
  - bundled dogtag enrollment helpers now output debugging info to stderr (#)
  - ipa-getcert: fix a crash when using DNS discovery to locate servers (#39)
  - getcert: fix displaying of pre-request pre-/post-save commands (#1178190,
    #1181022, patch by David Kupka)
  - use Zanata for translations
  - getcert list: list the certificate's profile name, if it contains one

* Tue Nov 18 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.76.8-1
- dogtag-submit: accept additional options to pass to the server when
  approving requests using agent creds (#1165155, patch by Jan Cholasta)
- getcert: print help output when 'status' isn't given any args (#1163541)

* Tue Nov 11 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.76.7-1
- correctly read CA not-valid-after dates on 32-bit machines (also reported by
  Natxo Asenjo), so that we don't spin on polling them (#1163023)

* Mon Nov 10 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.76.6-1

- fix a failure in self-tests

* Mon Nov 10 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.76.3-1
- fixes for bugs found by static analysis
- handle IDN correctly when doing service location using SRV records
- documentation updates

* Wed Nov  5 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
- rework the state machine so that we save an issued certificate's associated
  CA certificates, then re-read the certificate, then run the post hook and
  issue notifications, in that order, instead of saving CA certificates after
  running the post hook, which was always a surprising order (#1131700)
- add a generic dogtag-submit helper that doesn't include any IPA defaults,
  to make it easier to know the difference between paramenters it requires
  and parameters which are optional (#12)

* Tue Nov  4 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.76.2-1
- ipa-submit: when we fail to locate/contact LDAP or XML-RPC servers,
  use discovery to find them (#1136900)

* Fri Oct 31 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.76.1-1

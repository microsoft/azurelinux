# Implicit policy target.

# How to treat devices that don't match any rule in the

# * allow  - authorize the device
# * block  - block the device

#
# Present device policy.
#
# How to treat devices that are already connected when the
# daemon starts. One of:
#
# * allow        - authorize every present device
# * block        - deauthorize every present device
# * reject       - remove every present device
# * keep         - just sync the internal state and leave it

# Present controller policy.

#
# * allow        - authorize every present device
# * block        - deauthorize every present device
# * reject       - remove every present device

# Inserted device policy.
#
# How to treat USB devices that are already connected

#
# Restore controller device state.
#
# The USBGuard daemon modifies some attributes of controller
# devices like the default authorization state of new child device
# instances. Using this setting, you can controll whether the
# daemon will try to restore the attribute values to the state
# before modificaton on shutdown.
#
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS: If set to true, the USB authorization
# policy could be bypassed by performing some sort of attack on the
# daemon (via a local exploit or via a USB device) to make it shutdown
# and restore to the operating-system default state (known to be permissive).
#
RestoreControllerDeviceState=false

#
# Device manager backend
#
# Which device manager backend implementation to use. One of:
#
# * uevent - Netlink based implementation which uses sysfs to scan for present
#            devices and an uevent netlink socket for receiving USB device
#            related events.
# * dummy  - A dummy device manager which simulates several devices and device
#            events. Useful for testing.
#
DeviceManagerBackend=uevent

#!!! WARNING: It's good practice to set at least one of the !!!
#!!!          two options bellow. If none of them are set,  !!!
#!!!          the daemon will accept IPC connections from   !!!
#!!!          anyone, thus allowing anyone to modify the    !!!
#!!!          rule set and (de)authorize USB devices.       !!!

#
# Users allowed to use the IPC interface.
#
# A space delimited list of usernames that the daemon will
# accept IPC connections from.
#
# IPCAllowedUsers=username1 username2 ...

#
# Groups allowed to use the IPC interface.
#
# A space delimited list of groupnames that the daemon will
# accept IPC connections from.

#
# IPC access control definition files path.
#
# The files at this location will be interpreted by the daemon
# as access control definition files. The (base)name of a file
# should be in the form:
#
#   [user][:<group>]
#
# and should contain lines in the form:
#
#   <section>=[privilege] ...
#
# This way each file defines who is able to connect to the IPC
# bus and what privileges he has.

#
# Generate device specific rules including the "via-port"
# attribute.
#
# This option modifies the behavior of the allowDevice
# action. When instructed to generate a permanent rule,
# the action can generate a port specific rule. Because
# some systems have unstable port numbering, the generated
# rule might not match the device after rebooting the system.
#
# If set to false, the generated rule will still contain
# the "parent-hash" attribute which also defines an association
# to the parent device. See usbguard-rules.conf(5) for more
# details.

# USBGuard Audit events log backend
#
# One of:
#
# * FileAudit - Log audit events into a file specified by
#               AuditFilePath setting (see below)
# * LinuxAudit - Log audit events using the Linux Audit
#                subsystem (using audit_log_user_message)

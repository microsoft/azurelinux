# # Azure Linux defines both %fedora (from the Fedora 43 chroot) and %rhel=10
# # (from distro build defines). The upstream spec applies python3.patch on Fedora
# # and python-platform.patch on RHEL>7, expecting them to be mutually exclusive.
# # Since both conditions are true here, the patches conflict (same shebang lines).
# # Disable python-platform.patch — Azure Linux uses python3, not platform-python.

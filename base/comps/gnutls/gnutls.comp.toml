# The upstream spec enables bundled_gmp when rhel >= 9 && fips is on.
# Azure Linux defines rhel=10 and fips is on by default, which triggers this.
# However, the bundled gmp source (gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz) only exists in the RHEL
# lookaside — not in Fedora's — so the download fails. Since Azure Linux ships
# gmp as a standalone package, disable bundling and use the system copy instead.

# firewalld config file

# default zone
# The default zone used if an empty zone string is used.
# Default: public
DefaultZone=azurelinux

# Clean up on exit
# If set to no or false the firewall configuration will not get cleaned up
# on exit or stop of firewalld.
# Default: yes
CleanupOnExit=yes

# Clean up kernel modules on exit
# If set to yes or true the firewall related kernel modules will be
# unloaded on exit or stop of firewalld. This might attempt to unload
# modules not originally loaded by firewalld.
# Default: no
CleanupModulesOnExit=no

# IPv6_rpfilter
# Performs reverse path filtering (RPF) on IPv6 packets as per RFC 3704.
# Possible values:
#   - strict: Performs "strict" filtering as per RFC 3704. This check
#             verifies that the in ingress interface is the same interface
#             that would be used to send a packet reply to the source. That
#             is, ingress == egress.      
#   - loose: Performs "loose" filtering as per RFC 3704. This check only
#            verifies that there is a route back to the source through any
#            interface; even if it's not the same one on which the packet
#            arrived.
#   - strict-forward: This is almost identical to "strict", but does not perform
#                     RPF for packets targeted to the host (INPUT).
#   - loose-forward: This is almost identical to "loose", but does not perform
#                    RPF for packets targeted to the host (INPUT).
#   - no: RPF is completely disabled.
#
# The rp_filter for IPv4 is controlled using sysctl.
# Note: This feature has a performance impact. See man page FIREWALLD.CONF(5)
# for details.
# Default: strict
IPv6_rpfilter=strict

# IndividualCalls
# Do not use combined -restore calls, but individual calls. This increases the
# time that is needed to apply changes and to start the daemon, but is good for
# debugging.
# Default: no
IndividualCalls=no

# LogDenied
# Add logging rules right before reject and drop rules in the INPUT, FORWARD
# and OUTPUT chains for the default rules and also final reject and drop rules
# in zones. Possible values are: all, unicast, broadcast, multicast and off.
# Default: off
LogDenied=off

# FirewallBackend
# Selects the firewall backend implementation.
# Choices are:
#	- nftables (default)
#	- iptables (iptables, ip6tables, ebtables and ipset)
# Note: The iptables backend is deprecated. It will be removed in a future
# release.
FirewallBackend=nftables

# FlushAllOnReload
# Flush all runtime rules on a reload. In previous releases some runtime
# configuration was retained during a reload, namely; interface to zone
# assignment, and direct rules. This was confusing to users. To get the old
# behavior set this to "no".
# Default: yes
FlushAllOnReload=yes

# ReloadPolicy
# Policy during reload. By default all traffic except for established
# connections is dropped while the rules are updated. Set to "DROP", "REJECT"
# or "ACCEPT". Alternatively, specify it per table, like
# "OUTPUT:ACCEPT,INPUT:DROP,FORWARD:REJECT".
# Default: ReloadPolicy=INPUT:DROP,FORWARD:DROP,OUTPUT:DROP
ReloadPolicy=INPUT:DROP,FORWARD:DROP,OUTPUT:DROP

# RFC3964_IPv4
# As per RFC 3964, filter IPv6 traffic with 6to4 destination addresses that
# correspond to IPv4 addresses that should not be routed over the public
# internet.
# Defaults to "yes".
RFC3964_IPv4=yes

# StrictForwardPorts
# If set to yes, the generated destination NAT (DNAT) rules will NOT accept
# traffic that was DNAT'd by other entities, e.g. docker. Firewalld will be
# strict and not allow published container ports until they're explicitly
# allowed via firewalld.
# If set to no, then docker (and podman) integrates seamlessly with firewalld.
# Published container ports are implicitly allowed.
# Defaults to "no".
StrictForwardPorts=no

# NftablesFlowtable
# This may improve forwarded traffic throughput by enabling nftables flowtable.
# It is a software fastpath and avoids calling nftables rule evaluation for
# data packets. This only works for TCP and UDP traffic.
# The value is a space separated list of interfaces.
# Example value "eth0 eth1".
# Defaults to "off".
NftablesFlowtable=off

# NftablesCounters
# If set to yes, add a counter to every nftables rule. This is useful for
# debugging and comes with a small performance cost.
# Defaults to "no".
NftablesCounters=no

# NftablesTableOwner
# If set to yes, the generated nftables rule set will be owned exclusively by
# firewalld. This prevents other entities from mistakenly (or maliciously)
# modifying firewalld's rule set. If you intentionally modify firewalld's
# rules, then you will have to set this to "no".
# Defaults to "yes".
NftablesTableOwner=yes

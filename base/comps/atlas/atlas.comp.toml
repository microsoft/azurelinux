# Fedora's lapack-static 3.12.0-10 dropped the separate liblapack_pic.a file
# (it was redundant since static libs are now built with -fPIC by default).
# The spec references the old name in %prep when building a pruned LAPACK archive.
# Fixed upstream in atlas-3.10.3-33 (rawhide):
#   https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/atlas/c/f253f3a2d6c1 (rhbz#2433875)
# This overlay can be removed once we import from a Fedora version that includes the fix.

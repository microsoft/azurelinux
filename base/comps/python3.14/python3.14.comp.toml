# Override the wheel package prefix to use the Fedora-style unversioned name.
# Azure Linux sets %rhel, which causes python-rpm-macros to expand
# %python_wheel_pkg_prefix to "python3" (RHEL-style), requiring packages like
# python3-pip-wheel / python3-setuptools-wheel. Fedora repos only provide the
# unversioned python-pip-wheel / python-setuptools-wheel. This define forces
# the Fedora convention so wheel dependencies resolve correctly.

# Fix an Overlay

> **TODO:** This skill is a placeholder. Full instructions will cover:
>
> - Reading and interpreting overlay error messages
> - Diagnosing spec-* overlay failures (tag/section existence, regex issues)
> - Diagnosing file-* overlay failures (file not found, glob patterns)
> - Common failure patterns (upstream drift, wrong overlay type)
> - Using `prep-sources` with/without overlays to diff and debug

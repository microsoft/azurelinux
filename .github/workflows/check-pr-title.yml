# Workflows that run on 'pull_request_target' trigger need to be carefully

# input controlled by a PR submitter. We've reviewed this workflow and
# allow-listed it via the 'zizmor' comment below.

            Hello, and thank you for opening this pull request! 👋🏼  We appreciate the contribution.

            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

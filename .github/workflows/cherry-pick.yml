# This action cherry-picks CVE fix commits from fast-track branches to corresponding
# development branches for each version of Mariner. By default, the workflow is run
# whenever a CVE fix PR to a fast-track branch is merged. Additional target branches
# for cherry-pick can be specified by adding a comment to the original PR with the
# following syntax:
#   /cherry-pick <target-branch-1> <target-branch-2>
# Note the list of target branches is space-separated, and the commenter must be a
# member or owner of the repository for the action to work.
# After cherry-pick succeeds for a branch, a new PR will be created to merge the commit
# to that target branch, and a label will be added to the original PR to indicate that
# the commit has been cherry-picked to that branch.

# Stub workflow — A copy of this workflow must live on the default branch (3.0) so that the pull_request_target
# event can trigger it with access to secrets. It then delegates all real work to the reusable template on
# tomls/base/main, which has the scripts, prompts, and agent definitions.
#
# This two-stage design lets fork PRs trigger the review safely: the stub runs in the
# context of the default branch (with secret access), but the template checks out only
# .spec files (data) from the PR head — never executable code.
#
# A stub is needed because pull_request_target workflows always run in the context of the default branch, so they can't
# directly use a reusable workflow from the PR head (which would be a security risk since untrusted code could leak
# the secrets). By having the stub on the default branch, we can safely ensure only the trusted reusable workflow from
# the base is used, while still allowing the PR head to provide the .spec files as data input.

Unit Tests for AntiPatternDetector
==================================

Comprehensive test suite for the AntiPatternDetector module, which detects
common anti-patterns and issues in RPM spec files for Azure Linux packages.

Dependencies:
-------------
- AntiPatternDetector: Main detection module under test
- unittest: Python standard testing framework
- tempfile: Temporary directory management for isolated testing
- unittest.mock: Mocking capabilities for isolated unit testing

Usage:
------
Run all tests:
    python test_antipattern_detector.py

Run specific test:
    python -m unittest test_antipattern_detector.TestAntiPatternDetector.test_specific_method

Run with verbose output:
    python -m unittest test_antipattern_detector.py -v

class TestAntiPatternDetector(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Comprehensive test suite for AntiPatternDetector class.
    
    This test suite provides exhaustive coverage for all anti-pattern detection
    functionality in the AntiPatternDetector module. It validates the detection of
    common issues in RPM spec files used in Azure Linux packages, ensuring high
    quality and consistency in package specifications.
    
    Test Organization:
    ------------------
    The tests are organized into functional groups with clear section markers:
    
    1. **Patch File Issues** (`detect_patch_file_issues()` tests):
       - `test_missing_patch_file()`: Referenced patches not found in directory
       - `test_unused_patch_file()`: Orphaned patch files not referenced in spec
       - `test_cve_patch_mismatch()`: CVE-named patches without CVE documentation
       - `test_no_patch_issues()`: Negative test - all patches properly handled
    
    2. **CVE Reference Issues** (`detect_cve_issues()` tests):
       - `test_future_dated_cve()`: CVEs with unrealistic future years (>2026)
       - `test_missing_cve_in_changelog()`: CVEs in spec but not in changelog
       - `test_cve_documented_in_old_changelog_entry()`: CVEs in historical entries
       - `test_no_cve_references()`: Negative test - no CVE references present
    
    3. **Changelog Format Issues** (`detect_changelog_issues()` tests):
       - `test_missing_changelog_section()`: No %changelog section present
       - `test_empty_changelog_section()`: Empty %changelog with no entries
       - `test_invalid_changelog_format()`: Malformed changelog entry format
       - `test_valid_changelog_format()`: Negative test - proper format validation
    
    4. **Integration Testing** (`detect_all()` tests):
       - `test_detect_all_integration()`: Multi-category issue detection
       - `test_detect_all_no_issues()`: Negative test - clean spec file
    
    5. **Configuration and Data Structure Validation**:
       - `test_severity_mapping()`: Severity level configuration validation
       - `test_antipattern_dataclass()`: AntiPattern object creation and access
    
    6. **Edge Cases and Error Handling**:
       - `test_multiline_patch_references()`: Whitespace handling robustness
       - `test_cve_case_insensitive_matching()`: Case sensitivity behavior documentation
    
    Test Design Principles:
    -----------------------
    Each test method is designed to be:
    - **Independent**: No dependencies between test methods
    - **Deterministic**: Consistent results across multiple runs  
    - **Comprehensive**: Cover both positive and negative scenarios
    - **Realistic**: Use authentic Azure Linux spec file patterns
    - **Focused**: Test one specific aspect or scenario per method
    
    Test Data Strategy:
    -------------------
    - Uses realistic spec file content representative of Azure Linux packages
    - Includes both valid and invalid examples for thorough validation
    - Covers edge cases like empty content, malformed entries, boundary conditions
    - Validates both the detection logic and the data structure properties
    
    Assertion Patterns:
    -------------------
    Each test follows consistent assertion patterns:
    - Verify correct number of detected issues
    - Validate issue types and IDs match expectations
    - Check severity levels are appropriate
    - Confirm descriptive text includes relevant details
    - Assert line numbers are captured when available
    - Test both positive detection and negative (no false positives) scenarios
    
    Test Environment:
    -----------------
    - Uses temporary directories for isolated testing
    - Cleans up resources appropriately in tearDown()
    - Configures logging to reduce test noise
    - Supports both individual and batch test execution
    """
    
    def setUp(self):
        """
        Set up test fixtures before each test method.

        - Temporary directory for isolated file operations
        - Fresh AntiPatternDetector instance with default configuration
        - Standard test spec file path following Azure Linux conventions
        
        This ensures each test runs independently without interference
        from previous test state or file system modifications.

        - Resetting global state if modified
        - Cleaning up mock objects or external resources

        Test that detect_all() properly combines all detection methods.
        
        This comprehensive integration test validates that the detect_all() method
        correctly orchestrates all individual detection functions and aggregates
        their results. It uses a complex spec file scenario that intentionally
        contains multiple types of issues to ensure cross-functional detection works.
        
        Test Scenario Design:
        ---------------------
        The test spec contains deliberate issues across all categories:
        
        **Patch Issues**:
        - Missing patch: "missing-patch.patch" (referenced but not in file_list)
        - Unused patches: "unused-patch.patch", "CVE-2023-9999-fix.patch" (in file_list but not referenced)
        - CVE mismatch: "CVE-2023-9999-fix.patch" (CVE not mentioned in spec content)
        
        **CVE Issues**:
        - Future-dated CVE: "CVE-2030-1234" (year 2030 > 2026 threshold)
        - Missing in changelog: "CVE-2023-5678", "CVE-2030-1234" (in description but not changelog)
        
        **Changelog Issues**:
        - Invalid format: "Foo Bar 15 2024" (invalid day name)
        
        Expected Detection Results:
        ---------------------------
        The test should detect approximately 6+ distinct anti-pattern instances:
        1. `missing-patch-file`: missing-patch.patch
        2. `unused-patch-file`: unused-patch.patch (not referenced)
        3. `unused-patch-file`: CVE-2023-9999-fix.patch (not referenced)  
        4. `cve-patch-mismatch`: CVE-2023-9999 (patch exists but CVE not in spec)
        5. `future-dated-cve`: CVE-2030-1234 (unrealistic future year)
        6. `missing-cve-in-changelog`: CVE-2023-5678 (in description, not in changelog)
        7. `missing-cve-in-changelog`: CVE-2030-1234 (in description, not in changelog)
        8. `invalid-changelog-format`: "Foo Bar 15 2024" (malformed entry)
        
        Validation Strategy:
        --------------------
        - Confirms that issues from multiple detection categories are found
        - Verifies that the aggregation doesn't lose or duplicate issues
        - Ensures proper anti-pattern ID assignment across all categories
        - Validates that detect_all() returns the same results as individual calls
        
        This test serves as a comprehensive end-to-end validation of the entire
        anti-pattern detection pipeline and ensures all components work together
        correctly in realistic scenarios.

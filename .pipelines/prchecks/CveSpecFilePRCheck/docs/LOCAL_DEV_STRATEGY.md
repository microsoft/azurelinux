# Dual Authentication Strategy - Local Dev + Production Pipeline

## Problem
- **Local Development**: UMI doesn't work (requires Azure DevOps agent)
- **Production Pipeline**: UMI works automatically on agent pool
- **Need**: Test blob storage locally BEFORE deploying to pipeline

## Solution: DefaultAzureCredential Credential Chain

`DefaultAzureCredential` tries authentication methods in this order:
1. **Environment Variables** (AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)
2. **Managed Identity** (UMI/SMI - works in Azure DevOps)
3. **Azure CLI** (works locally if you're logged in)
4. **Visual Studio / VS Code** credentials
5. **Other methods...**

This means **same code works both locally and in pipeline**! üéâ

---

## Strategy

### For Local Development (You)
Use **Azure CLI authentication**:
```bash
# Login with your Microsoft account
az login

# Set correct subscription
az account set --subscription "EdgeOS_IoT_CBL-Mariner_DevTest"

# Run your Python code
# DefaultAzureCredential will use your Azure CLI credentials automatically!
python BlobStorageClient.py
```

**Your account needs**:
- Read/write access to `radarblobstore` storage account
- `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role (or similar)

### For Production Pipeline (Azure DevOps)
Use **Managed Identity (UMI)**:
- Agent pool already configured with UMI
- `DefaultAzureCredential` automatically detects and uses UMI
- No code changes needed!

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Local Testing Setup (Immediate)
1. ‚úÖ Grant YOUR user account blob permissions (temporary, for development)
2. ‚úÖ Test BlobStorageClient locally with Azure CLI auth
3. ‚úÖ Develop and test analytics JSON generation locally
4. ‚úÖ Test HTML/JSON upload locally

### Phase 2: Production Setup (For Pipeline)
1. ‚è≥ Grant UMI blob permissions (admin task)
2. ‚è≥ Configure public blob access (admin task)
3. ‚è≥ Deploy code to pipeline
4. ‚è≥ Test in pipeline with real PR

---

## Detailed Plan

### ‚úÖ TASK 1: Grant Your Account Local Dev Permissions
**You can do this yourself!**

```bash
# Login and set subscription
az login
az account set --subscription "EdgeOS_IoT_CBL-Mariner_DevTest"

# Get your user object ID
USER_OBJECT_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)
echo "Your Object ID: $USER_OBJECT_ID"

# Grant yourself Storage Blob Data Contributor role
az role assignment create \
  --assignee $USER_OBJECT_ID \
  --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/0012ca50-c773-43b2-80e2-f24b6377145c/resourceGroups/Radar-Storage-RG/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/radarblobstore"

echo "‚úÖ You now have blob storage access for local development!"
```

**This is safe because**:
- Only for development/testing
- Your account already has access to the subscription
- Follows least-privilege principle
- Can be removed later if needed

### ‚úÖ TASK 2: Test BlobStorageClient Locally

```bash
cd /home/abadawix/git/azurelinux/.pipelines/prchecks/CveSpecFilePRCheck

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test connection
python BlobStorageClient.py
```

**Expected result**: Should upload test HTML and JSON successfully!

### ‚úÖ TASK 3: Create Test Script
Create a test script to validate everything works locally before pipeline deployment.

### ‚úÖ TASK 4: Develop Analytics JSON Schema
Design and implement while testing locally with your credentials.

### ‚úÖ TASK 5: Implement AnalyticsDataBuilder
Test locally with sample data.

### ‚úÖ TASK 6: Update ResultAnalyzer
Add blob storage integration, test locally with mock data.

### ‚úÖ TASK 7: Add Credential Fallback Logic
Make code robust to work in both environments:
```python
# BlobStorageClient automatically handles this!
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
# In local: Uses Azure CLI
# In pipeline: Uses UMI
# No code changes needed!
```

### ‚è≥ TASK 8: Request Admin to Grant UMI Permissions
Once local testing is complete and working, admin grants UMI permissions for production.

### ‚è≥ TASK 9: Deploy to Pipeline
Push code to branch, test in actual pipeline.

### ‚è≥ TASK 10: Validate End-to-End
Create test PR, verify pipeline uploads to blob storage.

## Updated File Structure

```
.pipelines/prchecks/CveSpecFilePRCheck/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BlobStorageClient.py           # ‚úÖ DONE - works with both auth methods
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt                # ‚úÖ DONE - has azure-storage-blob
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_blob_storage.py            # üÜï TO CREATE - local test script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AnalyticsDataBuilder.py         # üÜï TO CREATE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ResultAnalyzer.py               # TO UPDATE - add blob integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CveSpecFilePRCheck.py          # TO UPDATE - initialize BlobStorageClient
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MANUAL_ADMIN_STEPS.md          # ‚úÖ DONE - for admin (UMI permissions)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md             # üÜï TO CREATE - for local testing
```

## Environment Variables for Testing

### Local Development
```bash
# No environment variables needed!
# DefaultAzureCredential uses Azure CLI automatically
# Just make sure you're logged in: az login
```

### Production Pipeline
```bash
# Already configured in pipeline YAML:
GITHUB_PR_NUMBER=$(System.PullRequest.PullRequestNumber)
BUILD_BUILDID=$(Build.BuildId)

# UMI automatically detected by DefaultAzureCredential
# No additional configuration needed!
```

## Testing Checklist

### Local Testing (Before Pipeline)
- [ ] Grant your account blob permissions
- [ ] Test BlobStorageClient.py standalone
- [ ] Create test_blob_storage.py and run it
- [ ] Verify HTML uploads successfully
- [ ] Verify JSON uploads successfully
- [ ] Check blob URLs are publicly accessible
- [ ] Test analytics JSON generation
- [ ] Test full workflow with mock PR data

### Pipeline Testing (After Local Works)
- [ ] Admin grants UMI permissions
- [ ] Admin configures public blob access
- [ ] Deploy code to test branch
- [ ] Create test PR with spec changes
- [ ] Verify pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Check HTML blob URL in GitHub comment
- [ ] Verify JSON analytics data in blob storage
- [ ] Validate UMI authentication worked (check logs)

---

## Benefits of This Approach

‚úÖ **No code duplication** - Same code works locally and in pipeline
‚úÖ **Faster development** - Test locally without pipeline runs
‚úÖ **Independent** - Don't wait for admin to grant UMI permissions
‚úÖ **Safe** - Your account permissions only affect your testing
‚úÖ **Production-ready** - Once local works, pipeline will work too
‚úÖ **Debuggable** - Can test and fix issues locally first

---

## Security Notes

### Local Development Permissions
- Your user account gets temporary blob access for development
- Scoped to specific storage account only
- Can be revoked after development is complete
- Standard practice for development workflows

### Production UMI Permissions
- UMI only works within Azure DevOps agents
- More secure than storing credentials
- No secrets in code or configuration
- Follows Azure best practices

## Next Steps - Immediate Actions

1. **YOU RUN** (right now):
```bash
# Grant yourself local dev permissions
az login
az account set --subscription "EdgeOS_IoT_CBL-Mariner_DevTest"
USER_OBJECT_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)
az role assignment create \
  --assignee $USER_OBJECT_ID \
  --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/0012ca50-c773-43b2-80e2-f24b6377145c/resourceGroups/Radar-Storage-RG/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/radarblobstore"
```

2. **I CREATE**:
- `test_blob_storage.py` - Test script
- `LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md` - Local setup guide
- `AnalyticsDataBuilder.py` - Analytics JSON builder

3. **WE TEST** together locally

4. **ADMIN GRANTS** UMI permissions (once local testing passes)

5. **WE DEPLOY** to pipeline

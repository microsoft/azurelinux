Subject: [PATCH] Avoid ldbl-96 stack corruption from range reduction of
 pseudo-zero (bug 25487).

Bug 25487 reports stack corruption in ldbl-96 sinl on a pseudo-zero
argument (an representation where all the significand bits, including
the explicit high bit, are zero, but the exponent is not zero, which
is not a valid representation for the long double type).

Although this is not a valid long double representation, existing
practice in this area (see bug 4586, originally marked invalid but
subsequently fixed) is that we still seek to avoid invalid memory
accesses as a result, in case of programs that treat arbitrary binary
data as long double representations, although the invalid
representations of the ldbl-96 format do not need to be consistently
handled the same as any particular valid representation.

This patch makes the range reduction detect pseudo-zero and unnormal
representations that would otherwise go to __kernel_rem_pio2, and
returns a NaN for them instead of continuing with the range reduction
process.  (Pseudo-zero and unnormal representations whose unbiased
exponent is less than -1 have already been safely returned from the
function before this point without going through the rest of range
reduction.)  Pseudo-zero representations would previously result in
the value passed to __kernel_rem_pio2 being all-zero, which is
definitely unsafe; unnormal representations would previously result in
a value passed whose high bit is zero, which might well be unsafe
since that is not a form of input expected by __kernel_rem_pio2.

Tested for x86_64.
